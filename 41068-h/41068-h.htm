<h2>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION</h2>

<p>The term syndicalism sounds strange to an English
reader. Its equivalent in English would be Unionism. A
syndicat is a union of workingmen, on a trade or on an industrial
basis, for the defense of economic interests.</p>

<p>Revolutionary Syndicalism, however, has a broader connotation
than the etymology of the term would suggest. A
critical analysis of existing institutions, a socialist ideal,
and a peculiar conception of revolutionary methods to be
used for the realization of the ideal&mdash;are all contained in
it. Revolutionary Syndicalism appears, therefore, as a
phase of the general movement towards a reorganization
of society on socialist principles.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Revolutionary Syndicalism cannot be treated, however,
exclusively as a phase of the evolution of Socialism. As
the term suggests, it is also a development of the French
Labor Movement. The organization which represents
Revolutionary Syndicalism in France is the General Confederation
of Labor (<i>La Confédération Générale du Travail</i>,
generally referred to as the C. G. T.)&mdash;the central
organization of the labor unions or syndicats in France.
The history of Revolutionary Syndicalism coincides almost
entirely with the history of the General Confederation,
and it may be said that its future is entirely bound
up with the destinies of this organization.</p>

<p>In fact, Revolutionary Syndicalism is an attempt to fuse
revolutionary socialism and trade unionism into one coherent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
movement. Peculiar conditions of French social
history have thrown the socialists and anarchists into the
syndicats and have secured their leadership there. In this
respect, Revolutionary Syndicalism is a unique and interesting
chapter in the history of both Socialism and Trades
unionism and of their mutual relations.</p>

<p>Revolutionary Syndicalism has attracted much attention
outside of France. Its more or less rapid development,
the turmoil into which it has thrown France several times,
the extreme ideas which it expresses, the violent methods
it advocates, and its attempts of proselytism outside of
France have awakened an interest in it. A number of
studies on the movement have appeared in German, Italian,
Russian and other European periodicals and books.
In English, however, the subject has not received the consideration
it would seem to deserve from the theoretical as
well as from the practical point of view.</p>

<p>Revolutionary Syndicalism is an aggressive movement.
Its aim is to do away with existing institutions and to reconstruct
society along new lines. It must, therefore, necessarily
call forth a definite attitude on the part of those
who become acquainted with it. Those who speak about
it are either its friends or its enemies, and even those who
want to be impartial towards it are generally unable to
resist the flood of sentiment which such a movement sets
loose in them.</p>

<p>Impartiality, however, has been the main effort of the
writer of this study. It has appeared to him more important
to describe the facts as they are and to understand
the conditions back of the facts, than to pass sentence
whether of approval or of condemnation. He has made
the effort, therefore, to suppress his personality entirely
in all that part of his work which is purely descriptive.
The method adopted has been to describe ideas and facts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
sympathetically&mdash;whether syndicalist or anti-syndicalist,
whether promoting or hindering the development of Revolutionary
Syndicalism.</p>

<p>The idea that has guided the writer is as follows: Let
us imagine that social phenomena could be registered automatically.
All social facts would then be recorded with all
the sympathies and antipathies with which they are mixed
in real life, because the latter are part of the facts.
When social descriptions go wrong it is not because they
are tinged with feeling, but because they are colored by
those feelings which they arouse in the writer and not by
those which accompany them in reality. The main task
of the writer, therefore, is to try to enter into the feelings
which go along with the facts which he is describing.</p>

<p>This means that the writer must alternately feel and
think as a different person. However difficult this may be,
it is still possible by an effort of imagination prompted by
a desire to get at the truth.</p>

<p>This method seems more correct than an attempt to remain
entirely indifferent and not to be swayed by any
feeling. Indifference does not secure impartiality; it results
mostly in colorlessness. For instance, were the
writer to remain indifferent or critical while describing the
syndicalist ideas, the latter could not be outlined with all
the force and color with which they appear in the exposition
of their representatives. This would not produce an
impartial description, therefore, but a weak and consequently
untrue one. On the contrary, by trying to feel
and to think as a revolutionary syndicalist, while describing
the syndicalist ideas, it is possible to come nearer to
reality. The same method is used in the description of
anti-syndicalist ideas and efforts.</p>

<p>The result seems to the writer to be the creation of the
necessary illusion and the reproduction of the atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
in which the movement developed. A critical and personal
attitude has been taken only when the writer wished to express
his own views. Whether the writer has been more
successful than others in this attempt, is for the reader to
decide.</p>

<p>From the point of view taken in this essay, Revolutionary
Syndicalism has to be described both as a theory and as
a practice. The effort is made throughout, however, to
consider the theory in close relation to the practice.</p>

<p>The first chapter is introductory and serves merely to
give the necessary historical perspective. This explains its
brevity.</p>

<p>Revolutionary Syndicalism is undoubtedly a peculiar
product of French life and history. Still many of its ideas
have a general character and may be of interest to men and
women of other countries. After all, the problems that
confront the whole civilized world to-day are the same, and
the conditions in which their solution has to be tried are
everywhere alike in many respects. It has been the writer's
sincere hope throughout this work that the history of syndicalism
may stimulate the readers of this essay to reflection
and criticism that may be of help to them in their
efforts to advance the cause of social progress in their own
country.</p>

<p>The author wishes to make grateful acknowledgments to
Professor Vladimir G. Simkhovitch, Professor Henry
Rogers Seager and other professors of Columbia University
who have in one way or another aided him in the
prosecution of his work; but especially is he indebted to
Professor Franklin H. Giddings for invaluable criticisms
and suggestions which have guided him throughout his
work, and to Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman for encouragement
and advice, and help in making it possible for the
work to appear in its present form.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>

<p>The term syndicalism no longer needs an introduction to
the English reader. Within the past two years it has been
naturalized in all English-speaking countries, and has become
more or less widely known. It has even been enriched
as a result of its migration. In France it simply expressed
the comparatively innocent idea of trade unionism, while
both in England and America it has come to designate those
explosive and aggressive forms of labor unionism which the
French described in the words &#8220;revolutionary syndicalism.&#8221;
The English use of the term has reacted upon the
French syndicalists who have now generally dropped the
adjective &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; and speak of their movement as
&#8220;le syndicalisme&#8221; or &#8220;le syndicalisme français.&#8221; In a
word, as a result of recent industrial events the world
over, syndicalism has emerged as a new movement of international
scope and character. The most significant manifestation
of this new development was the first international
syndicalist congress which was held in London during the
month of September of last year and at which delegates
from France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, the United
States, England and other countries were present.</p>

<p>The appearance of syndicalist tendencies in other countries
has thrown some new light upon the subject. What
was considered at one time the peculiar product of France
or of the &#8220;Latin spirit,&#8221; appears now to transcend the
boundaries of particular countries and of kindred racial
groups. It is evidently more closely related to industrial
conditions. But its emergence in such countries as England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and the United States destroys the familiar hypothesis that
syndicalism is bred only by the small workshop. The latter
may explain some peculiar aspects of French syndicalism;
it can not explain the methods of direct action and the
syndicalist spirit common to all countries.</p>

<p>The explanation seems to me to lie in the direction indicated
in the concluding chapter of this book. Three essential
causes for the development of French syndicalism are
pointed out in it: namely, political disillusionment, the
economic weakness of the labor elements, and the comparatively
static character of French industry. Recent industrial
developments in England and the United States
prove that the same conditions explain the appearance of
syndicalist tendencies everywhere. The disappointment of
the British workers in the political possibilities of the Labor
Party, the general mistrust of &#8220;politicians&#8221; and the actual
disfranchisement of large elements of the working population
in the United States are facts which are not disputed,
and the influence of which in recent industrial events is no
longer denied. The comparative weakness of sectional
unionism in England and of the unskilled elements in the
American labor movement has been brought home to the
workers themselves and has determined their change of
tactics. Some French syndicalists have criticized the author
of this book for laying too much emphasis on the financial
weakness of the syndicats in France. But that is a
misunderstanding on their part; the emphasis is not on
finances, but on weakness which may be the result of many
circumstances. Labor unions may have millions in the
banks, and still be weak economically on account of the
technical conditions of the industry or of the strong organization
of the employers. A consciousness of weakness in
certain respects must not lead necessarily to submission or
to despair. But it generally leads to efforts in new directions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and to new methods of action. It has resulted in the
amalgamation of unions in England and in the wonderful
effort to create a general spirit of solidarity among all elements
of labor the world over.</p>

<p>The comparatively static character of industrial life in
France has no parallel in England or the United States.
This explains why in the latter two countries the ideal aspects
of syndicalism have obtained less significance, than in
France. In an atmosphere of slow industrial growth, possibilities
of immediate industrial gains do not loom up large
in the eyes of the workers and no hope of considerable permanent
improvement under given conditions is aroused;
on the other hand, the forcible acquisition of the whole industrial
equipment and its co-operative management seem
comparatively easy.</p>

<p>In the concluding chapter of this book, the possibilities
of a change in the character of French syndicalism which
were indicated in the first edition are left unchanged.
Developments are not yet ripe to warrant any definite conclusion.
Of course, some very important phenomena have
taken place. The most significant, perhaps, is the development
of the iron and steel industry in the eastern parts of
France, particularly in the Department Meurthe-et-Moselle.
Something very similar to what happened in the steel industry
of the United States is happening there; large plants
are being erected, gigantic industrial combinations are being
formed, labor organizations are relentlessly fought, and
foreign workers are imported from Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Austria and other countries. Under these conditions,
new problems are thrust upon the French labor movement,
and it is significant that the Federation of the metal
workers has played the leading part in the recent campaign
against the &#8220;anarchistic&#8221; tendencies of the General Confederation
of Labor and has demanded a return to the platform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of Amiens (1906) and to a more definite program of
labor demands. This does not mean a change in the ideas
of French syndicalism, but it certainly indicates a tendency
towards the more positive work of organization and of
purely trade conquests.</p>

<p>It may be many years, before the struggle of tendencies
in the General Confederation of Labor is determined either
way. Meanwhile, the significance of French Syndicalism
to the world of thought and action has become greater than
it was before. France continues to present both the ideas
and activities of syndicalism in the most lucid and developed
form.</p>

<p>This fact, I take it, has been partly responsible for the
keen interest in the first edition of this book and for the
necessity of bringing forth a second edition.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The democratic social movement has overleaped its
platform and escaped out of the hands of its instigators.
It is larger than any school of ideas and will not be bound
by any program. It can be analyzed in part, and in general
terms described, but it can no longer be defined.</p>

<p>Socialism as one phase of this unmanaged and unmanageable
tide, has itself been profoundly affected by the
magnitude, the complexity, and the waywardness of the
mass motion. It now has its &#8220;Right&#8221; and its &#8220;Left.&#8221;
There is a conservative, and there is a radical socialism.
Each proclaims the class struggle, and both demand the collective
ownership of the chief means of production. But
conservative socialism lays stress upon collective ownership,
and would move toward it by peaceful, evolutionary steps.
It relies on the ballot, believes in legislation, in law, and
in government; while radical socialism proclaims &#8220;the
revolution,&#8221; plans for the general strike, and preaches the
expediency of <i>sabotage</i> and violence.</p>

<p>At first sight almost identical with radical socialism is
Syndicalism, which, however, proves upon examination
to be both more and less than any socialistic program. In
its most characteristic expression, syndicalism denies the
state and would substitute for it a purely voluntary collectivism.
So far it is at one with anarchism, and there are
those who conceive of syndicalism as an anarchistic movement
in opposition to socialism. The trade-union organization
of labor the world over is looked upon by the syndicalist
as the natural basis and agency of his enterprise, quite as
existing political organizations are accepted by the conservative
or parliamentary socialist as the best preliminary
norms from which to evolve a new social order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
In this division of the forces of social democracy into
right and left groups over the question of organization and
control, we have a significant demonstration of the inadequacy
of that Marxian analysis which resolves all social
conflict into the antagonism of economic classes. More
profound than that antagonism, and in the order of time
more ancient, is the unending warfare between those who
believe in law and government for all, and those who believe
in law and government for none. The more or less
paradoxical character of the socialistic movement at the
present moment is attributable to the circumstance that,
for the time being, these antagonistic forces of socialism
and anarchism are confronting a common enemy&mdash;the individualist,
who believes in law and government for everybody
but himself.</p>

<p>To describe, explain and estimate a phenomenon so complex
as modern revolutionary syndicalism is a task from
which the economist and the historian alike might well
shrink. To understand it and to enable readers to understand
it is an achievement. I think that I am not speaking
in terms of exaggeration in saying that Dr. Levine has
been more successful in this arduous undertaking than any
predecessor. His pages tell us in a clear and dispassionate
way what revolutionary syndicalism is, how it began, and
how it has grown, what its informing ideas and purposes
are, and by what methods it is forcing itself upon the serious
attention of the civilized world. I think that it is a
book which no student of affairs can afford to overlook,
or to read in any other spirit than that of a sincere desire
to know what account of the most profound social disturbance
of our time is offered by a competent reporter of the
facts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Labor Movement in France to the Commune</span>
(1789-1871)</h2>

<p>The economic legislation of the French Revolution was
guided by individualistic ideas which expressed the interests
of the rising middle classes who felt a necessity of
removing the obstacles in the way of economic initiative
and of personal effort. These interests and ideas dictated
the law of March 2-17, 1791, which abolished the guilds
and inaugurated the era of competition in France (<i>Liberté
du Travail</i>). The law declared that henceforth
everybody was &#8220;free to do such business, exercise such
profession, art, or trade, as he may choose.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The abolition of the guilds cleared the way for the technical
changes that had just begun and the development of
which was yet in the future. These changes may be summarized
as the application of science to industry and the
introduction of machinery. The process went on in France
irregularly, affecting different industries and different localities
in various degrees. The first machine (<i>machine à
vapeur</i>) was introduced in France about 1815; in 1830
there were about 600 in operation. Some idea of the later
changes may be gained from the following table giving the
number of machines in France from 1839 to 1907:

<p>The introduction of machinery meant the absorption of
a larger part of the population in industry, the concentration
of industry in a smaller number of establishments and the
absolute and relative increase in the numbers of the working
population of France.</p>

<p>This class of the population was regulated in its economic
action for nearly a century by another law passed June
14-17, 1791, and known by the name of its author as the
law Le Chapelier. The law Le Chapelier, though dictated
by the same general interests and ideas as the law on the
guilds, was made necessary by special circumstances.</p>

<p>The abolition of the guilds had as one of its effects an
agitation among the journeymen for higher wages and for
better conditions of employment. During the summer of
1791, Paris was the scene of large meetings of journeymen,
at which matters of work and wages were discussed.
The movement spread from trade to trade, but the struggle
was particularly acute in the building trades. Profiting by
the law of August 21, 1790, which gave all citizens the
&#8220;right to assemble peacefully and to form among themselves
free associations subject only to the laws which all
citizens must obey,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the carpenters formed <i>L'Union fraternelle
des ouvriers en l'art de la charpente</i>, an association
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
ostensibly for benevolent purposes only, but which in
reality helped the carpenters in their struggle with their
masters. The masters repeatedly petitioned the municipality
of Paris to put an end to the &#8220;disorders,&#8221; and to the
&#8220;tyranny&#8221; of the journeymen. The masters complained
that a general coalition of 80,000 workingmen had been
formed in the capital and that the agitation was spreading
to the provincial towns.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The municipal authorities tried
to meet the situation, but their &#8220;notices&#8221; and &#8220;decrees&#8221;
had no effect. They then appealed to the Constituent Assembly
for a general law on associations and combinations.
The result was the law Le Chapelier.</p>

<p>The report by which the bill was introduced brought out
very clearly the individualistic ideas by which the legislators
of the Revolution were inspired. &#8220;Citizens of certain
trades,&#8221; read this report, &#8220;must not be permitted to assemble
for their pretended common interests. There is no
longer any corporation (guild) in the State; there is but
the particular interest of each individual and the general
interest....&#8221; And further, &#8220;It is necessary to abide by
the principle that only by free contracts, between individual
and individual, may the workday for each workingman
be fixed; it is then for the workingman to maintain the
agreement which he had made with his employer.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The law identified the new combinations with the ancient
guilds. Its first clause declared that &#8220;whereas the abolition
of all kinds of corporations of citizens of the same estate
(<i>état</i>) and of the same trade is one of the fundamental
bases of the French Constitution, it is prohibited to re-establish
them <i>de facto</i> under any pretext or form whatsoever&#8221;.
The second clause formulated the prohibition to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
form trade organizations in terms which left nothing to
be desired in clearness and precision. It read: &#8220;The citizens
of the same estate or trade, entrepreneurs, those who
run a shop, workingmen in any trade whatsoever, shall not,
when assembled together, nominate presidents, nor secretaries,
nor syndics, shall not keep any records, shall not
deliberate nor pass resolutions nor form any regulations
with reference to their pretended common interests.&#8221; The
fourth clause declared all acts contrary to this law unconstitutional,
subject to the jurisdiction of the police tribunals,
punishable by a fine of 500 <i>livres</i> and by a temporary
suspension of active rights of citizenship. The sixth and
seventh clauses determined higher penalties in cases of
menace and of violence. The eighth clause prohibited all
&#8220;gatherings composed of artisans, of workingmen, of journeymen
or of laborers, or instigated by them and directed
against the free exercise of industry and work to which
all sorts of persons have a right under all sorts of conditions
agreed upon by private contract (<i>de gré a gré</i>)&#8221;.
&#8220;Such gatherings are declared riotous, are to be dispersed
by force, and are to be punished with all the severity which
the law permits.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>After the law was passed by the Assembly, the author
of the law, Le Chapelier, added:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have heard some say that it would be necessary to make an
exception in favor of the Chambers of Commerce in cities.
Certainly you understand well that none of us intend to
prevent the merchants from discussing their common interests.
I therefore propose to insert into the proceedings
the following clause: &#8220;The National Assembly, considering
that the law which it has just passed does not concern the
Chambers of Commerce, passes to the order of the day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
The proposition was adopted. &#8220;This last vote,&#8221; remarks
the official historian of the <i>Office du Travail</i>, &#8220;demonstrates
sufficiently that the law was especially directed against the
meetings, associations and coalitions of workingmen.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The determination to prevent collective action on the
part of the workingmen also guided the legislative activity
of Napoleon. In 1803, during the Consulate, a law was
passed against coalitions; the same law contained a provision
whereby all workingmen were to have a special certificate
(<i>livret</i>)<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>  which subjected them to a strict surveillance
of the police. The law of 1803 against coalitions was
replaced in 1810 by the clauses 414-416 of the Penal Code
which prohibited and punished all kinds of coalitions.
These articles which made strikes and all collective action
a crime, and which showed clearly discrimination against
workingmen, were as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Art. 414. Any coalition among those who employ workingmen,
tending to force down wages unjustly and abusively,
followed by an attempt or a commencement of execution, shall
be punished by imprisonment from six days to one month and
by a fine of 200 to 3,000 francs.</p>

<p>Art. 415. Any coalition on the part of the workingmen to
cease work at the same time, to forbid work in a shop, to
prevent the coming or leaving before or after certain hours
and, in general, to suspend, hinder or make dear labor, if there
has been an attempt or a beginning of execution, shall be punished
by imprisonment of one month to three months maximum;
the leaders and promoters shall be punished by imprisonment
of two to five years, and</p>

<p>Art. 416. There shall also be subject to penalty indicated
in the preceding article and according to the same distinctions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
those workingmen who shall have declared fines, prohibitions,
interdictions and any other proscriptions under the name of
condemnations and under any qualification whatsoever against
the directors of the shops and employers, or against each other.</p>

<p>In the case of this article as well as in that of the preceding,
the leaders and promoters of the crime, after the expiration
of their fine, may be made subject to the surveillance of the
police for two years at least and five years at most.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> </p></blockquote>

<p>The prohibition against combination and organization
was aggravated for the workingmen by articles 291-294 of
the Penal Code which forbade any kind of associations of
more than twenty persons. These articles were made more
stringent by the Law of 1834 which prohibited associations
even of twenty persons, if they were branches of a
larger association.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The workingmen, however, soon began to feel that the
<i>Liberté du Travail</i> as interpreted by the laws of the
country put them at a disadvantage in the struggle for existence.
Individually each one of them was too weak to
obtain the best bargain from his employer. This was notoriously
so in the industries in which machinery was making
headway, but the relations between employer and workingmen
were aggravated by competition even in those industries
where the old conditions of trade did not change perceptibly
for some time. Competition forced the employer
to become a &#8220;calculator above everything else&#8221; and &#8220;to
consider the workingman only from the point of view of
the real value which his hands had on the market without
heed to his human needs.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>  The workingman, on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
hand, to remedy his individual helplessness was driven to
disregard the law and to enter into combinations with his
fellow-workers for concerted action.</p>

<p>The figures published by the Department of Justice give
the number of those prosecuted for violating the law on
strikes&mdash;the number of accused, of acquitted and of condemned.
These figures are incomplete. They give, however,
some idea of the frequency and persistence with which
the workingmen had recourse to strikes in spite of the law.
The figures have been published since 1825. The table on
the next page gives the annual figures from that date to
1864, when a new law on strikes was passed.</p>

<p>There is other information to show that the strikes often
assumed the character of a general movement, particularly
under the influence of political disturbances. During the
years that followed the Revolution of July (1830) the
workingmen of France were at times in a state of agitation
throughout the entire country, formulating everywhere particular
demands, such as the regulation of industrial
matters, collective contracts and the like.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In many cases, the strikes were spontaneous outbursts of
discontent among unorganized workingmen. Frequently,
however, the strikes were either consciously called out or
directed by organizations which existed by avoiding the
law in various ways.</p>

<p>These organizations were of three different types: the
<i>compagnonnages</i>, the friendly societies (<i>mutualités</i>) and
the &#8220;societies of resistance&#8221;.</p>

<p>The <i>compagnonnages</i> originated under the guild-system
and can be traced back as far as the fifteenth century.
Their development was probably connected with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
custom of traveling which became prevalent among the
journeymen of France about that time.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>  A journeyman
(called <i>compagnon</i> in French) would usually spend some
time in visiting the principal cities of France (make his
<i>tour de France</i>) to perfect himself in his trade. A traveling
<i>compagnon</i> would be in need of assistance in many
cases and the <i>compagnonnages</i> owed their development to
the necessity of meeting this want.</p>

<p>The <i>compagnonnages</i> consisted of bachelor journeymen
only. If a member married or established himself as master,
he left the <i>compagnonnage</i>. Besides, admission to the
<i>compagnonnage</i> was dependent on tests of moral character
and of technical skill. Thus, the <i>compagnonnages</i> always
embraced but a small part of the workingmen&mdash;the élite
from the technical point of view. To attain the required
technical standard, members had to pass some time as aspirants
before they could become <i>compagnons</i>.</p>

<p>The organization of the <i>compagnonnages</i> was very
simple. All the <i>compagnons</i> of the same trade lived together
in one house, usually in an inn, kept by the so-called
<i>mère</i> (mother) or <i>père</i> (father) of the trade. The <i>compagnons</i>
were generally the only boarders in the house. If
not numerous enough to occupy the entire house, they had
one hall for their exclusive occupation. Here they held
their meetings, initiated new members, and kept their
records and treasury. Here, also, <i>compagnons</i> arriving
from other towns made themselves &#8220;recognized&#8221; by special
signs and symbols.</p>

<p>All the <i>compagnons</i> of France were divided among
three &#8220;orders&#8221; called <i>devoirs</i>. The <i>devoirs</i> had strange
names indicating the legends with which the origins of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
these organizations were connected. The <i>devoir</i>, &#8220;Sons of
Master Jack&#8221; (<i>Enfants de Maitre Jacques</i>) was founded,
according to the story, by one of the master-builders of
King Solomon's Temple. The &#8220;Sons of Solomon&#8221; (<i>Enfants
de Solomon</i>) were sure that their order was founded
by King Solomon himself. The &#8220;Sons of Master Soubise&#8221;
regarded another builder of Solomon's Temple as the
founder of their <i>devoir</i>. Each <i>devoir</i> consisted of a number
of trades, and sometimes one and the same trade was
divided between two <i>devoirs</i>.</p>

<p>Ceremonies and rites constituted an inseparable part of
the <i>compagnonnages</i>. The initiation of a new member, the
&#8220;recognition&#8221; of a newly arrived <i>compagnon</i>, the meeting
of two traveling <i>compagnons</i> on the road, etc., were
occasions for strange and complicated ceremonies which
had to be accurately performed. These ceremonies were
due in a large measure to the secrecy in which the <i>compagnonnages</i>
developed under the ancient régime, persecuted
as they were by the royal authorities, by the church, and by
the master-craftsmen.</p>

<p>Within the <i>compagnonnages</i> the feeling of corporate exclusiveness
and the idea of hierarchical distinctions were
strong. Emblems of distinction, such as ribbons, canes,
etc., were worn on solemn occasions, and the way in which
they were worn, or their number, or color, indicated the
place of the <i>compagnonnage</i> within the whole corporate
body. Many riots and bloody encounters were occasioned
between <i>devoir</i> and <i>devoir</i> and between different <i>compagnonnages</i>
within each <i>devoir</i> by disputes over &#8220;ribbons&#8221;
and other emblems appropriate to each. For instance, the
joiners were friends of the carpenters and of the stonecutters,
but were enemies of the smiths whom the other two
trades accepted. The smiths rejected the harness-makers.
The blacksmiths accepted the wheelwrights on condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
that the latter wear their colors in a low buttonhole; the
wheelwrights promised but did not keep their promise; they
wore their colors as high as the blacksmiths; hence hatred
and quarrels. The carpenters wore their colors in their
hats; the winnowers wanted to wear them in the same way;
that was enough to make them sworn enemies.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>  Besides,
the <i>compagnonnages</i> did not strive to embrace all members
of the same trade or all trades. On the contrary, they
were averse to initiating a new trade and it sometimes took
decades before a new trade was fully admitted into the
organization.</p>

<p>While these features harked back to the past, the economic
functions of the <i>compagnonnages</i> anticipated and really
were a primitive form of the later syndicat. The <i>compagnonnages</i>
offered effective protection to the <i>compagnons</i> in
hard stresses of life as well as in their difficulties with their
masters. &#8220;The &#8216;devoir&#8217; of the compagnons&#8221; (read the
statutes of one of these societies) &#8220;is a fraternal alliance
which unites us all by the sacred ties of friendship, the
foundations of which are: virtue, frankness, honesty, love
of labor, courage, assistance and fidelity.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>  These abstract
terms translated themselves in life into concrete deeds of
mutual aid and of assistance which were immensely valuable
to the traveling <i>compagnons</i>. A traveling <i>compagnon</i>,
on arriving at a city or town, would only have to make
himself &#8220;recognized&#8221; and his fellow-compagnons would
take care of him. He would be given lodging and food.
Employment would be found for him. If sick or in distress,
he would receive aid. If he wished to leave the town
to continue his <i>tour de France</i>, he would be assisted and
would be accompanied some distance on the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
With their simple organization, the <i>compagnons</i> were
able to exert a strong economic influence. They served as
bureaus of employment. One <i>compagnon</i>, elected <i>rouleur</i>,
was charged with the duty of finding employment for <i>compagnons</i>
and &#8220;aspirants&#8221;. He kept a list of those in need
of work and placed them in the order of their inscription.
Usually the masters themselves addressed the <i>rouleurs</i> for
workingmen, when in need of any.</p>

<p>This fact gave the <i>compagnonnages</i> a control over the
supply of labor. They could withhold labor from a master
who did not comply with their demands. They could direct
their members into other towns of the <i>Tour</i> if necessary,
as everywhere the <i>compagnons</i> would find friends
and protection. They could, therefore, organize strikes
and boycott a master or workshop for long periods of time.
In fact, by these methods the <i>compagnonnages</i> struggled
for higher wages and better conditions of employment as
far back as the sixteenth century. During the Great Revolution
the <i>compagnonnages</i> existed in twenty-seven trades
and directed the strike-movement described above. They
attained the height of their development during the first
quarter of the nineteenth century when they were the only
effective workingmen's organizations exerting an influence
in the economic struggles of the time.</p>

<p>The <i>compagnonnages</i> persisted in several trades during
the larger part of the nineteenth century. After 1830, however,
their influence declined. The new industrial conditions
reduced the significance of the personal skill of the
workingmen, shifted the boundaries of the ancient trades,
and entirely transformed most of them. The rapid development
of the modern means of communication made the
<i>tour de France</i> in its old form an anachronism. The spread
of democratic and secular ideas brought the medieval usages
and ideas of the <i>compagnonnages</i> into disrepute and ridicule.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Several attempts to reform the <i>compagnonnages</i> and
to bring them into harmony with the new conditions of life
were made by members of the organization, but with no
results.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>While the <i>compagnonnages</i> were reconstituting themselves
during the Consulate and the First Empire, another
form of organization began to develop among the workingmen.
This was the friendly or benevolent society for
mutual aid especially in cases of sickness, accident or death.
Several such societies had existed before the Revolution
and the law Le Chapelier was directed also against them.
&#8220;It is the business of the nation,&#8221; was the opinion of Le
Chapelier, accepted by the Constituent Assembly, &#8220;it is the
business of the public officials in the name of the nation to
furnish employment to those in need of it and assistance to
the infirm&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>  Friendly societies, however, continued to
form themselves during the nineteenth century. They
were formed generally along trade lines, embracing members
of the same trade. In a general way the government
did not hinder their development.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatrice Webb and Mr. Sidney Webb have shown
that a friendly society has often been the nucleus of a trade
union in England. In France the friendly societies for a
long time played the part of trade unions. The charge of
promoting strikes and of interfering with industrial matters
was often brought against them.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>  There were 132 such
trade organizations in Paris in 1823 with 11,000 members,
and their numbers increased during the following years.</p>

<p>The form of organization called into being by the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
economic conditions was the <i>société de résistance</i>, an organization
primarily designed for the purpose of exercising
control over conditions of employment. These societies of
resistance assumed various names. They usually had no
benefit features or passed them over lightly in their statutes.
They emphasized the purpose of obtaining collective contracts,
scales of wages, and general improvements in conditions
of employment. These societies were all secret, but
free from the religious and ceremonial characteristics of the
<i>compagnonnages</i>.</p>

<p>One of the most famous of these societies in the history
of the French working-class was the <i>Devoir Mutuel</i>,
founded by the weavers of Lyons, in 1823. This society
directed the famous strikes of the weavers in 1831 and
1834. Its aim, as formulated in its statutes, was: first, to
practice the principles of equity; second, to unite the weavers'
efforts in order to obtain a reasonable wage for their
labor; third, to do away with the abuses of the factory, and
to bring about other improvements in &#8220;the moral and physical
condition&#8221; of its members. The society had 3,000
members in 1833.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In 1833 the smelters of copper in Paris formed themselves
into a society which was to help them in their resistance
against employers. Two francs a day was to be
paid to every member who lost employment because he
did not consent to an unjust reduction in his wages or for
any other reason which might be regarded as having in
view the support of the trade; in other cases of unemployment,
no benefit was allowed, in view of the fact that in
ordinary times the smelters were seldom idle.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>  The society
was open to all smelters, without any limitation of age; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
was administered by a council assisted by a commission of
representatives from the shops, elected by the members of
the society of each shop. The society was soon deprived,
however, of its combative character by the government.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>A strong society of resistance was organized by the
printers of Paris in 1839. Though secret, it gained the adherence
of a large part of the trade. In 1848 it had 1,200
members&mdash;half of all the printers at that time in Paris.
It was administered by a committee. Through its initiative
a mixed commission of employers and workingmen was
organized which adopted a general scale of wages. This
commission also acted as a board of mediation and
conciliation in disputes between employers and workingmen.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The <i>compagnonnages</i>, <i>mutualités</i> and resistance-societies
aimed partly or exclusively to better conditions of employment
by exerting pressure upon employers. These societies
reveal the efforts that were being made by workingmen to
adjust themselves to the economic conditions of the time.
But after 1830, other ideas began to find adherents among
the French workingmen; namely, the ideas of opposition
to the entire economic régime based on private property
and the idea of substituting for this system a new industrial
organization.</p>

<p>The history of the socialist movement of France before
1848 can not here be entered into. It has been written and
rewritten and is more or less known. For the purposes of
this study, it is only necessary to point out that during
this period, and particularly during the revolutionary
period of 1848, the idea of co-operation, as a means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
abolishing the wage system, made a deep impression upon
the minds of French workingmen.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The idea of co-operation had been propagated before
1848 by the Saint-Simonists and Fourierists, and particularly
by Buchez who had outlined a clear plan of co-operation
in his paper <i>L'Européen</i> in 1831-2. Similar ideas were
advanced during the forties by a group of workingmen who
published <i>L'Atelier</i>. But only with the outbreak of the
Revolution of 1848, and under the influence of Louis Blanc,
did the co-operative idea really become popular with the
workingmen. Between 1848 and 1850 the enthusiasm for
co-operative societies was great, and a considerable number
of them were formed. On July 6, 1848, the Constituent Assembly
voted a loan of 3,000,000 francs for co-operative
societies, and this sum was divided among 26 societies in
Paris and 36 in the provinces.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>  But the number of those
founded without assistance was much greater; about 300 in
Paris and many more in the provinces. Of these societies
most perished within a short time while the rest were dissolved
by the administration of Napoleon III after the <i>coup-d'état</i>
of 1851.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The Revolution of 1848 was an important moment in
the history of the French working-class. Though the
socialist idea of the &#8220;Organization of Work&#8221; (<i>L'Organisation
du Travail</i>) which was so prominent during the
Revolution passed into history after the days of June, it
left an impression upon the minds of French workingmen.
The belief in a possible social transformation became a tradition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
with them. Besides, the Revolution gave a strong
impulse to purely trade organizations such as the <i>sociétés
de résistance</i>. Before 1848 they had existed in a few trades
only. The period of the Revolution witnessed the formation
of a large number of them in various trades and
strengthened the tendency towards organization which had
manifested itself before.</p>

<p>During the first decade of the Second Empire all workingmen's
organizations were persecuted; most of them perished;
others went again into secrecy or disguised themselves
as mutual aid societies.</p>

<p>With the advent of the second decade of the Empire the
labor movement acquired an amplitude it had never had
before. Its main characteristic during this period was a
decided effort to break the legal barriers in its way and to
come out into the open. The workingmen's chief demands
were the abolition of the law on coalitions and the right
to organize.</p>

<p>The workingmen were given an opportunity to express
their views and sentiments on occasions of National and
International Exhibitions. It had become a custom in
France to send delegations of workingmen to such exhibitions.
In 1849 the Chamber of Commerce of Lyons sent a
delegation of workingmen to the National Exhibition in
Paris. In 1851 the municipality of Paris sent some workingmen
to the International Exhibition in London. A delegation
was sent again to London in 1862 and to Paris in
1867.</p>

<p>The workingmen-delegates published reports in which
they formulated their views on the condition of their respective
trades and expressed their demands and aspirations.
These reports have been called the <i>cahiers</i> of the
working-class. The authors of the reports&mdash;workingmen
themselves, elected by large numbers of workingmen&mdash;were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
representatives in the true sense of the term and voiced the
sentiments and ideas of a large part of the French workingmen
of their time.</p>

<p>The reports published by the delegates of 1862 contain
a persistent demand for freedom to combine and to organize.
The refrain of all the reports is: &#8220;Isolation kills
us&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>  The trade unions of England made a deep impression
on the French delegates and strengthened their conviction
of the necessity of organization. &#8220;Of 53 reports
emanating from 183 delegates of Paris, 38 by 145 delegates
express the desire that syndical chambers be organized in
their trades.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The government of the Empire, which hoped to interest
the workingmen in its existence, gave way before their
persistent demands. In 1864, in consequence of a strike
of Parisian printers which attracted much public attention,
the old law on coalitions was abolished and the right to
strike granted.</p>

<p>The right to strike, however, was bound up with certain
other rights which the French workingmen were still denied.
Unless the latter had the right to assemble and to
organize, they could profit but little by the new law on
coalitions. Besides, the French workingmen were generally
averse to strikes. The reports of 1862, though demanding
the freedom of coalition, declared that it was not the
intention of the workingmen to make strikes their habitual
procedure. The delegates of 1867, who formed a commission
which met in Paris for two years, discussing all the
economic problems that interested the workingmen of the
time, were of the same opinion. A special session of the
Commission was devoted to the consideration of the means
by which strikes might be avoided. All agreed that, as one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the delegates expressed it, strikes were &#8220;the misery of the
workingmen and the ruin of the employer&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>  and should
be resorted to only in cases of absolute necessity. What
the delegates demanded was the right to organize and to
form &#8220;syndical chambers&#8221;. They hoped that with the
help of these organizations, they would avoid strikes and
improve their economic condition.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1868, a number of delegates to the
Exhibition of 1867 were received by the Minister of Agriculture,
Commerce and Public Works to present their
views and demands. The vice-president of the Commission,
M. Parent, indicated clearly what the workingmen
meant by &#8220;syndical chambers&#8221; in the following words:</p>

<blockquote><p>We all agree to proceed by way of conciliation, but we all have
also recognized the necessity of guaranteeing our rights by a
serious organization which should give the workingmen the
possibility of entering easily and without fear into agreement
with the employers.... It is thus in order to avoid strikes,
guaranteeing at the same time the wages of the workingmen,
that the delegates of 1867 solicit the authorization to establish
syndicats in each trade in order to counter-balance the formidable
organization of the syndical chambers of the merchants
and manufacturers.... The workingmen's syndical
chambers, composed of syndics elected by the votes of the
workingmen of their trade, would have an important rôle to
fulfil. Besides the competent experts which they could always
furnish for the cases subject to the jurisdiction of the
prud'hommes, for justices of the peace and for the tribunals
of Commerce, they could furnish arbiters for those conflicts
which have not for their cause an increase in wages. Such
are: the regulations of the workshops, the use of health-endangering
materials, the bad conditions of the machinery and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the factory which affect the health of the workingmen and
often endanger their lives, the protection of the inventions
made by workingmen, the organization of mutual and professional
education, which cannot be entirely instituted without
the help of the men of the workshop, etc.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> </p></blockquote>

<p>On the 30th of March, 1868, the Minister of Commerce
and Public Works announced that without modifying
the law on coalitions, the government would henceforth
tolerate workingmen's organizations on the same grounds
on which it had heretofore tolerated the organizations of
employers. With this act began the period of toleration
which lasted down to 1884, when the workingmen's organizations
were brought under the protection of a special
law.</p>

<p>The declaration of toleration gave free scope to the
workingmen to form their syndical chambers. Some syndicats
had been openly formed before. In 1867, the shoemakers
had formed a society&mdash;the first to bear the name of
syndicat&mdash;which had openly declared that it would support
members on strike and would try to defend and to raise
wages. But only after the declaration of the government
in 1868 did these societies begin to increase in numbers.</p>

<p>While organizing for resistance, the workingmen during
this period, however, placed their main hopes in co-operation;
the co-operative society of production was to them
the only means of solving the labor question. As one of
the delegates to the Workingmen's Commission of 1867
put it: &#8220;Salvation is in association&#8221; (<i>Le salut c'est l'association</i>).<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The main function of the syndical chamber was
to promote the organization of co-operative societies.</p>

<p>The revival of enthusiasm for co-operative societies began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
in 1863. Men of different political and economic views
helped the movement. It found supporters in liberal economists,
like M. Say and M. Walras; it was seconded by
Proudhon and his followers, while a number of communists
took an active part in it. Profiting by the experience
of 1848-50, the workingmen now adopted a new plan.
The co-operative society of production was to be the crowning
part of the work, resting upon a foundation of several
other organizations. First the members of one and the
same trade were to form a syndical chamber of their trade.
The syndical chamber was to encourage the creation of a
&#8220;society of credit and savings&#8221; which should have for its
aim the collection of funds by regular dues paid by the
members. Such &#8220;societies of credit and savings&#8221; began
to develop after 1860, and they were considered very important;
not only because they provided the funds, but
also and mainly because they helped the members to become
acquainted with one another and to eliminate the inefficient.
With a society of credit in existence, it was deemed necessary
to create a co-operative of consumption. The productive
co-operative society was to complete this series of
organizations which, supporting one another, were to give
stability to the entire structure.</p>

<p>The plan was seldom carried out in full. Co-operatives
of production were formed without any such elaborate
preparation as outlined above. However, many &#8220;societies
of credit and saving&#8221; were formed. In 1863 there were
200 of them in Paris; and in September, 1863, a central
bank, <i>La Société du Credit au Travail</i> was organized.
Similar central banks were formed in Lyons, Marseilles,
Lille and other large cities.</p>

<p>In Paris the <i>Credit au Travail</i> became the center of the
co-operative movement between 1863 and 1868. It subsidized
successively <i>L'Association</i> (Nov., 1864-July, 1866)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and <i>La Co-opération</i> (Sept., 1866-Feb., 1867)&mdash;magazines
devoted to the spread of co-operative ideas. It gave advice
and information for forming co-operatives. Most of the
co-operative enterprises of the period were planned and
first elaborated in the councils of this society. Finally it
furnished the co-operatives with credit. Its business done
in 1866 amounted to 10½ million francs.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In 1868 the co-operative movement, after several years
of development, suffered a terrible blow. On November
2nd, the <i>Credit au Travail</i> became bankrupt; it had immobilized
its capital, and had given out loans for too long
periods, while some of the other loans were not reimbursed.
The bank had to suspend payment and was closed.
The disaster for the co-operative movement was complete.
The <i>Credit au Travail</i> seemed to incarnate the co-operative
movement; &#8220;and its failure made many think that the co-operative
institution had no future&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The failure of the co-operative movement turned the
efforts of the workingmen into other channels. They now
began to join the &#8220;International Association of Workingmen&#8221;
in increased numbers and to change their ideas and
methods.</p>

<p>The &#8220;International&#8221;, as is well known, was formed in
1864 by French and English workingmen. The French
section, during the first years of its existence, was composed
mainly of the followers of Proudhon, known as <i>mutuellistes</i>.
The program of the <i>mutuellistes</i> was a peaceful
change in social relations by which the idea of justice&mdash;conceived
as reciprocity or mutuality of services&mdash;would be
realized. The means advocated were education and the
organization of mutual aid societies, of mutual insurance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
companies, of syndicats, of co-operative societies and the
like. Much importance was attached to the organization
of mutual credit societies and of popular banks. It was
hoped that with the help of cheap credit the means of production
would be put at the disposal of all and that co-operative
societies of production could then be organized
in large numbers. The <i>Mutuellistes</i> emphasized the idea
that the social emancipation of the workingmen must be
the work of the workingmen themselves. They were opposed
to state intervention. Their ideal was a decentralized
economic society based upon a new principle of
right&mdash;the principle of mutuality&mdash;which was &#8220;the idea of
the working-class&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>  Their spokesman and master was
Proudhon who formulated the ideas of <i>mutuellisme</i> in his
work, <i>De la Capacité Politique des Classes Ouvrières</i>.</p>

<p>Between 1864 and 1868, the &#8220;International&#8221; met with
little success in France. The largest number of adherents
obtained by it during this period was from five to eight
hundred. Persecuted by the government after 1867, it was
practically dead in France in 1868.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>  But in 1869 it reappeared
with renewed strength under the leadership of
men of collectivist and communist ideas, which were partly
a revival and survival of the ideas of 1848, partly a new development
in socialist thought.</p>

<p>One current of communist ideas was represented by the
Blanquists. Blanqui, a life-long conspirator and an ardent
republican who had been the leader of the secret revolutionary
societies under the Monarchy of July, took up his
revolutionary activity again during the latter part of the
Second Empire. A republican and revolutionary above
everything else, he had, however, gradually come to formulate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in a more precise way a communistic program, to
be realized by his party when by a revolutionary upheaval
it would be carried into power. The Blanquists denounced
the &#8220;co-operators&#8221; and the &#8220;mutuellistes&#8221; and
called upon the workingmen to organize into secret societies
ready, at a favorable moment, to seize political power.
Towards the end of the Second Empire, the Blanquists
numbered about 2,500 members in Paris, mainly among the
Republican youth.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The other current of communist ideas had its fountainhead
in the &#8220;International&#8221; which Caesar de-Paepe, Marx
and Bakounine succeeded in winning over to their collectivist
ideas. The congresses of the &#8220;Association&#8221; in Brussels
in 1868 and in Bâle in 1869 adopted resolutions of a
collectivist character, and many members of the French section
were won over to the new ideas.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The success of the &#8220;International&#8221; in France in 1869
was the sudden result of the strike-movement which swept
the country during the last years of the Second Empire.
The members of the &#8220;International&#8221; succeeded in obtaining
financial support for some strikers. This raised the
prestige of the &#8220;Association&#8221;, and a number of syndicats
sent in their collective adhesion. It is estimated that
toward the end of 1869 the &#8220;International&#8221; had a membership
of about 250,000 in France.</p>

<p>These facts had their influence on the French leaders of
the &#8220;International&#8221;. They changed their attitude toward
the strike, declaring it &#8220;the means <i>par excellence</i> for the
organization of the revolutionary forces of labor&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>  The
idea of the general strike suggested itself to others.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>  At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the Congress of Bâle in 1869, one of the French delegates
advocated the necessity of organizing syndicats for two
reasons: first, because &#8220;they are the means of resisting the
exploitation of capital in the present;&#8221; and second, because
&#8220;the grouping of different trades in the city will form the
commune of the future&#8221; ... and then ... &#8220;the government
will be replaced by federated councils of syndicats
and by a committee of their respective delegates regulating
the relations of labor&mdash;this taking the place of politics.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Under the influence of the &#8220;International&#8221; the syndicats
of Paris&mdash;there were about 70 during the years 1868-1870&mdash;founded
a local federation under the name of <i>Chambre
Fédérale des sociétés ouvrières de Paris</i>. This federation
formulated its aim in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote><p>This agreement has for its object to put into operation the
means recognized as just by the workingmen of all trades for
the purpose of making them the possessors of all the instruments
of production and to lend them money, in order that they
may free themselves from the arbitrariness of the employer
and from the exigencies of capital.... The federation has
also the aim of assuring to all adhering societies on strike the
moral and material support of the other groups by means of
loans at the risk of the loaning societies.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These organizations were entirely swept away by the
events of 1870-71: the Franco-Prussian War, the Proclamation
of the Republic, and especially the Commune.
After 1871 the workingmen had to begin the work of organization
all over again. But the conquests of the previous
period were not lost. The right to strike was recognized.
The policy of tolerating workingmen's organizations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
was continued, notwithstanding a few acts to the
contrary. But, above all, the experience of the workingmen
was preserved. The form of organization which they
generally advocated after the Commune was the syndicat.
The other forms (<i>i. e.</i>, the <i>Compagnonnages</i> and the
secret <i>Société de résistance</i>) either disappeared or developed
independently along different lines, as the friendly
societies.</p>

<p>In other respects, the continuity of the labor movement
after the Commune with that of the preceding period
was no less evident. As will be seen in the following chapter
the problems raised and the solutions given to them by the
French workingmen for some time after the Commune
were directly related to the movement of the Second Empire.
The idea of co-operation, the <i>mutuellisme</i> of Proudhon,
and the collectivism of the &#8220;International&#8221; reappeared
in the labor movement under the Third Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Origin of the General Confederation of Labor</span>
(1872-1895)</h2>

<p>The vigorous suppression of the Commune and the
political events which followed it threw the French workingmen
for some time into a state of mental depression.
Though trade-union meetings were not prohibited, the
workingmen avoided the places which had been centers of
syndical activity before the Commune. Full of suspicion
and fear, they preferred to remain in isolation rather than
to risk the persecution of the government.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, the initiative in reconstituting
the syndicats was taken by a republican journalist, Barberet.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Barberet was prompted to undertake this &#8220;honorable
task&#8221; by the desire to do away with strikes. He
had observed the strike movement for some years, and had
come to the conclusion that strikes were fatal to the workingmen
and dangerous to the political institutions of the
country. His observations had convinced him that the Second
Empire had fallen largely in consequence of the strike
movement during 1868-70, and he was anxious to preserve
the Republic from similar troubles. As he expressed it,
strikes were &#8220;a crime of <i>lèse-democratie</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>  which it was
necessary to prevent by all means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Barberet outlined the following program for the syndicats.
They were to watch over the loyal fulfilment of contracts
of apprenticeship; to organize employment bureaus;
to create boards of conciliation composed of an equal number
of delegates from employers and from workingmen
for the peaceful solution of trade disputes; to found
libraries and courses in technical education; to utilize their
funds not to &#8220;foment strikes&#8221;, but to buy raw materials
and instruments of labor; and finally, &#8220;to crown these
various preparatory steps&#8221; by the creation of co-operative
workshops &#8220;which alone would give groups of workingmen
the normal access to industry and to commerce&#8221;
and which would in time equalize wealth.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Under Barberet's influence and with his assistance syndicats
were reconstituted in a few trades in Paris during
1872. These syndicats felt the necessity of uniting into a
larger body, and in August of the same year they founded
the <i>Cercle de l'Union Ouvrière</i>, which was to form a counter-balance
to the employers' organization <i>L'Union Nationale
du Commerce et de l'Industrie</i>. The <i>Cercle</i> insisted on
its peaceful intentions; it declared that its aim was &#8220;to
realize concord and justice through study&#8221; and to convince
public opinion &#8220;of the moderation with which the
workingmen claim their rights.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>  The <i>Cercle</i> was nevertheless
dissolved by the government.</p>

<p>The syndicats, however, were left alone. They slowly
increased in numbers and spread to new trades. There
were about 135 in Paris in 1875. Following the example
of the syndicats of the Second Empire, they organized delegations
of workingmen to the Exhibitions of Vienna in
1873 and of Philadelphia in 1876. But their supreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
effort was the organization of the first French Labor Congress
in Paris in 1876.</p>

<p>The Congress was attended by 255 delegates from Paris
and 105 from the provincial towns. The delegates represented
syndicats, co-operative societies and mutual aid societies.
The program of the Congress included eight subjects:
(1) The work of women; (2) syndical chambers;
(3) councils of <i>prud'hommes</i>; (4) apprenticeship and
technical education; (5) direct representation of the working
class in Parliament; (6) co-operative associations of
production, of consumption and of credit; (7) old-age
pensions; (8) agricultural associations and the relations
between agricultural and industrial workers.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the Congress were calm and moderate.
The organizers of the Congress were anxious not
to arouse the apprehension of the government and not to
compromise the republicans with whose help the Congress
was organized. The reports and the discussions of the Congress
showed that the syndical program outlined by Barberet
was accepted by almost all the delegates. They insisted
upon the necessity of solving peaceably all industrial
difficulties, expressed antipathy for the strike and above all
affirmed their belief in the emancipating efficacy of co-operation.
At the same time they repudiated socialism,
which one of the delegates proclaimed &#8220;a bourgeois
Utopia&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The syndicats held a second congress in 1876 in Lyons.
The Congress of Lyons considered the same questions as
did that of Paris, and gave them the same solutions. In
general, the character of the second congress was like that
of the first.</p>

<p>The third Labor Congress held in Marseilles in 1879, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a new departure in the history of the French labor movement.
It marked the end of the influence of Barberet and
of the &#8220;co-operators&#8221; and the beginning of socialist influence.
The Congress of Marseilles accepted the title of
&#8220;Socialist Labor Congress&#8221;, expressed itself in favor of
the collective appropriation of the means of production and
adopted a resolution to organize a workingmen's social
political party.</p>

<p>This change in views was brought about by a concurrence
of many circumstances. The moderate character of
the syndicats between 1872-1879 had been due in large
measure to the political conditions of France. The cause of
the Republic was in danger and the workingmen were cautious
not to increase its difficulties. But after the elections
of 1876 and 1877 and upon the election of Grevy to the
Presidency, the Republic was more or less securely established,
and the workingmen thought that they should now
be more outspoken in their economic demands. The Committee
which had organized the Congress of Paris had
formulated these sentiments in the following terms: &#8220;From
the moment that the republican form of government was
secured&#8221;, wrote the Committee, &#8220;it was indispensable for
the working-class, who up to that time had gone hand in
hand with the republican bourgeoisie, to affirm their own
interests and to seek the means which would permit them
to transform their economic condition.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>  It was believed
that the means to accomplish this task was co-operation.
The belief in co-operation was so intense and general at
that time that one of the delegates to the Congress of Paris,
M. Finance,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>  himself an opponent of co-operation, predicted
a large co-operative movement similar to the movements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of 1848-50 and 1864-67. The prediction did not
come true. Nothing important was accomplished in this
field, and the hopes in co-operation receded before the impossibility
of putting the idea into practice. The critics
and opponents of co-operation did the rest to discredit the
idea. But when the idea of co-operation lost its influence
over the syndicats, the ground was cleared for socialism.
The Congress of Lyons had declared that &#8220;the syndicats
must not forget that the wage-system is but a transitory
stage from serfdom to an unnamed state.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>  When the
hope that this unnamed state would be brought about by
co-operation was gone, the &#8220;unnamed&#8221; state obtained a
name, for the Socialists alone held out to the workingmen
the promise of a new state which would take the place of
the wage system.</p>

<p>On ground thus prepared the Socialists came to sow their
seed. A group of collectivists, inspired by the ideas of the
&#8220;International&#8221;, had existed in Paris since 1873.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>  But
this group began to attract attention only in 1877 when it
found a leader in Jules Guesde. Jules Guesde is a remarkable
figure in the history of French Socialism and has played
a great part in shaping the movement. He had edited a
paper, <i>Les Droits de l'Homme</i>, in Montpelier in 1870-1 and
had expressed his sympathy for the Commune. This cost
him a sentence of five years in prison. He preferred exile,
went to Switzerland, there came into contact with the &#8220;International&#8221;
and was influenced by Marxian ideas.</p>

<p>On his return to France, Jules Guesde became the spokesman
and propagandist of Marxian or &#8220;scientific socialism&#8221;.
Fanatical, vigorous, domineering, he soon made
himself the leader of the French collectivists. Towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the end of 1877, he founded a weekly, <i>L'Égalité</i>, the first
number of which outlined the program which the paper intended
to defend. &#8220;We believe,&#8221; wrote <i>L'Égalité</i>, &#8220;with
the collectivist school to which almost all serious minds of
the working-class of both hemispheres now belong, that the
natural and scientific evolution of mankind leads it irresistibly
to the collective appropriation of the soil and of
the instruments of labor.&#8221; In order to achieve this end,
<i>L'Égalité</i> declared it necessary for the proletariat to constitute
itself a distinct political party which should pursue
the aim of conquering the political power of the State.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The collectivists found a few adherents among the
workingmen who actively propagated the new ideas. In
1878, several syndicats of Paris: those of the machinists,
joiners, tailors, leather dressers and others, accepted the
collectivist program.</p>

<p>The collectivist ideas were given wider publicity and
influence by the persecution of the government. In 1878,
an international congress of workingmen was to be held
in Paris during the International Exhibition. The Congress
of Lyons (1878) had appointed a special committee
to organize this international congress. Arrangements
were being made for the congress, when the government
prohibited it.</p>

<p>The more moderate elements of the Committee gave way
before the prohibition of the government, but Guesde and
his followers accepted the challenge of the government and
continued the preparations for the Congress. The government
dispersed the Congress at its very first session and
instituted legal proceedings against Guesde and other delegates.</p>

<p>The trial made a sensation and widely circulated the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
ideas which Guesde defended before the tribunal. From the
prison where they were incarcerated the collectivists
launched an appeal &#8220;to the proletarians, peasant proprietors
and small masters&#8221; which contained an exposition of
collectivist principles and proposed the formation of a distinct
political party. The appeal gained many adherents
from various parts of France.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The idea of having workingmen's representatives in
Parliament had already come up at the Congress of Paris
(1876). This Congress, as indicated above, had on its
program the question of the &#8220;Representation of the Proletariat
in Parliament.&#8221; The reports on this question read
at the Congress were extremely interesting. The &#8220;moderate
co-operators&#8221; and &#8220;Barberetists&#8221;, as they were nicknamed
by the revolutionary collectivists, insisted in these
reports upon the separation which existed between bourgeois
and workingmen, upon the inability of the former to
understand the interests and the aspirations of the latter,
and upon the consequent necessity of having workingmen's
representatives in Parliament. These reports revealed the
deep-seated sentiments of the workingmen which made it
possible for the ideas of class and class struggle to spread
among them.</p>

<p>The Congress of Lyons (1878) had advanced the question
a step further. It had adopted a resolution that journals
should be created which should support workingmen-candidates
only.</p>

<p>With all this ground prepared, the triumph of the Socialists
at the Congress of Marseilles (1879) was not so sudden
as some have thought it to be. The influences which had
brought about this change in sentiment were clearly outlined
by the Committee on Organization, as may be seen
from the following extract:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span></p>

<blockquote><p>From the contact of workingmen-delegates from all civilized
nations that had appointed a rendezvous at the International
Exhibition, a clearly revolutionary idea disentangled
itself.... When the International Congress was brutally dispersed
by the government, one thing was proven: the working
class had no longer to expect its salvation from anybody
but itself.... The suspicions of the government with regard
to the organizers of the Congress, the iniquitous proceedings
which it instituted against them, have led to the revolutionary
resolutions of the Congress which show that the French proletariat
is self-conscious and is worthy of emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To a similar conclusion had come the Committee on
Resolutions appointed by the Congress of Lyons. In the
intervals between the two Congresses, it had a conference
with the deputies of the Department of Rhone and could
report only failure. The deputies, one of whom belonged
to the Extreme Left, were against the limitation of hours
of work in the name of liberty, and against the liberty of
association in the name of the superior rights of the State.
&#8220;The remedy to this state of affairs,&#8221; concluded the Committee,
&#8220;is to create in France a workingmen's party such
as exists already in several neighboring states.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The Congress of Marseilles carried out the task which the
collectivists assigned to it. A resolution was adopted declaring
that the co-operative societies could by no means be considered
a sufficiently powerful means for accomplishing the
emancipation of the proletariat. Another declared the aim
of the Congress to be: &#8220;The collectivity of soil and of subsoil,
of instruments of labor, of raw materials&mdash;to be given
to all and to be rendered inalienable by society to whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
they must be returned.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>  This resolution was adopted by
73 votes against 23.</p>

<p>The Congress also constituted itself a distinct party
under the name of the &#8220;Federation of Socialist Workingmen
of France&#8221;. The party was organized on a federalist
principle. France was divided into six regions: (1) Center
or Paris; (2) East or Lyons; (3) Marseilles or South; (4)
Bordeaux or West; (5) North or Lille; (6) Algeria. Each
region was to have its regional committee and regional congress
and be autonomous in its administration. A general
committee was to be appointed by the Congress of the Federation,
to be held annually in each of the principal regional
towns in turn.</p>

<p>After the Congress of Marseilles (1879) the leadership
of the syndical movement passed to the Socialists. This
led to a split at the next Congress held in Havre in 1880.
The &#8220;moderates&#8221; and &#8220;co-operators&#8221; separated from the
revolutionary collectivists. The former grouped themselves
about <i>L'Union des Chambres Syndicales Ouvrières de
France</i>. They held two separate congresses of their own in
1881 and 1882, which attracted little attention and were of
no importance. The <i>Union des Chambres Syndicales</i> confined
itself to obtaining a reform of the law on syndicats.</p>

<p>The Collectivists themselves, however, were not long
united. The movement was soon disrupted by internal
divisions and factions. At the Congress of Marseilles
(1879) the triumph of collectivism was assured by elements
which had the principles of collectivism in common,
but which differed in other points. In Havre (1880) these
elements were still united against the &#8220;moderate&#8221; elements.
But after the Congress of Havre they separated more and
more into distinct and warring groups.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The first differentiation took place between the parliamentary
socialists on the one hand, and the communist-anarchists
on the other. Both divisions had a common aim;
the collective appropriation of the means of production.
They did not differ much in their ideas on distribution;
there were communists among the parliamentary socialists.
What separated them most was difference in method. The
anarchists rejected the idea that the State, which in their
view was and always had been an instrument of exploitation,
could ever become an instrument of emancipation,
even in the hands of a socialist government. The first act
in the Social Revolution, in their opinion, had to be the destruction
of the State. With this aim in view, the anarchists
wished to have nothing to do with parliamentary
politics. They denounced parliamentary action as a &#8220;pell-mell
of compromise, of corruption, of charlatanism and of
absurdities, which does no constructive work, while it destroys
character and kills the revolutionary spirit by holding
the masses under a fatal illusion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>  The anarchists
saw only one way of bringing about the emancipation of
the working-class; namely, to carry on an active propaganda
and agitation, to organize groups, and at an opportune
moment to raise the people in revolt against the State
and the propertied classes; then destroy the State, expropriate
the capitalist class and reorganize society on communist
and federalist principles. This was the Social
Revolution they preached.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>From 1883 onward the anarchist propaganda met with
success in various parts of France, particularly in Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and in the South. There were thousands of workingmen
who professed the anarchist ideas, and the success of the
anarchists was quite disquieting to the socialists.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The socialists, on the contrary, called upon the workingmen
to participate in the parliamentary life of the country.
Political abstention, they asserted, is neither helpful
nor possible.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>  The workingman believes in using his right
to vote, and to ignore his attitude of mind is of no avail.
Besides, to bring about the transformation of capitalist
society into a collectivist society, the political machinery
of the State must be used. There is no other way of accomplishing
this task. The State will disappear after the
socialist society has been firmly established. But there is
an inevitable transitory period when the main economic
reforms must be carried out and during which the political
power of the State must be in the hands of the socialist
party representing the working-class. The first act of the
Social Revolution, therefore, is to conquer the political
power of the State.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Within the socialist ranks themselves further divisions
soon took place. In 1882, at the Congress of St. Etienne,
the party was split into two parts; one part followed
Guesde, the other followed Paul Brousse. The latter part
took the name of <i>Parti ouvrier socialiste révolutionnaire
français</i>&mdash;it dropped the word &#8220;<i>révolutionnaire</i>&#8221; from
its title in 1883&mdash;and continued to bear as sub-title, the name
&#8220;Federation of socialist workingmen of France.&#8221; Guesde's
party took the name of <i>Parti Ouvrier Français</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Parti Ouvrier Français</i> claimed to represent the
&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; and &#8220;scientific&#8221; socialism of Marx. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
accepted the familiar doctrines of &#8220;orthodox&#8221; Marxism,
which it popularized in France. It affirmed its revolutionary
character by denying the possibility of reforms in capitalist
society and by insisting upon the necessity of seizing
the political power of the State in a revolutionary way.</p>

<p>In 1886 J. Guesde wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the capitalist régime, that is, as long as the means of production
and of existence are the exclusive property of a few
who work less and less, all rights which the constitutions and
the codes may grant to others, to those who concentrate within
themselves more and more all muscular and cerebral work, will
remain always and inevitably a dead letter. In multiplying
reforms, one only multiplies shams (<i>trompe-l'oeil</i>).<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Inability to carry out real reforms was ascribed to both
national legislative bodies and to the municipalities. Therefore,</p>

<blockquote><p>if the party has entered into elections, it is not for the purpose
of carving out seats of councillors or deputies, which it
leaves to the hemorrhoids of bourgeois of every stamp, but
because the electoral period brings under our educational influence
that part of the masses which in ordinary times is
most indifferent to our meetings.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The municipalities conquered were to become just so
many centres of recruiting and of struggle. The <i>Parti
Ouvrier</i> was to be a &#8220;kind of recruiting and instructing
sergeant preparing the masses for the final assault upon
the State which is the citadel of capitalist society.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>  For
only a revolution would permit the productive class to seize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the political power and to use it for the economic expropriation
of capitalistic France and for the nationalization
or socialization of the productive forces. Of course no
man and no party can call forth a revolution, but when
the revolution which the nineteenth century carried within
itself arose as a result of national and international complication,
the <i>Parti Ouvrier</i> would be the party to assume
the rôle of directing it.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Parti Ouvrier</i> adopted a centralized form of organization.
It became in time the strongest and best organized
socialist party of France. It was particularly strong in
the <i>Department du Nord</i> and among the textile workers.
It was also known as the &#8220;Guesdist&#8221; party, after its leader
Guesde.</p>

<p>The <i>Parti Ouvrier</i> denounced the members of the <i>Parti
Ouvrier révolutionnaire socialiste</i>, or &#8220;Broussists,&#8221; also
thus named after their leader Brousse, as &#8220;opportunists and
possibilists&#8221; because they believed in the possibility of reforms
and had said that it was necessary &#8220;to split up our
program until we make it finally possible.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>  The nickname,
<i>possibilists</i>, has remained as another designation of
the <i>Broussists</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Broussists</i> cared little for the theories of Marx.
They were disposed to allow larger differences of doctrine
within their ranks and more local autonomy in their organization.
They ascribed much importance to municipal
politics. They conceived the conquest of political power as
a more peaceful process of a gradual infiltration into the
municipal, departmental and national legislative bodies.
But like the &#8220;Guesdists,&#8221; they were collectivists and took
the class struggle as their point of departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
From the very outset, the <i>Broussists</i> concentrated their
efforts upon gaining an entrance into Parliament and into
the municipalities. They had a numerous following in
Paris among the working population, and among the lower
strata of the middle class.</p>

<p>The split between <i>Guesdists</i> and <i>Broussists</i> was followed
by another in the ranks of the latter. In 1887 the <i>Broussists</i>
succeeded in electing seven of their members to the
municipal council of Paris. This led to internal difficulties.
A number of party members were discontented with the organization
which they claimed was entirely &#8220;bossed&#8221; by
its leaders. They grouped themselves in their turn about
J. Allemane and became known as &#8220;Allemanists.&#8221; The
Allemanists accused the Broussists of being too much absorbed
in politics and of neglecting the propaganda and
organization of the party. In 1890 they separated from
the Broussists and constituted a socialist party of their own.
The Allemanists absorbed the more revolutionary elements
of the party and were the leading spirits in some of the
largest and strongest syndicats.</p>

<p>Two more socialist groups must be mentioned in order
that the reader may have a complete view of the socialist
world in which the syndicats of France were moving during
this period. These two were the Blanquists and the Independent
Socialists.</p>

<p>The Blanquists&mdash;known also as the <i>Comité Révolutionnaire
Central</i>&mdash;were held together by a bond of common
tradition, namely, by their loyalty to the name of Blanqui,
spoken of in the preceding chapter. The leaders of the
Blanquists were men who had taken a more or less prominent
part in the Commune and who had returned to France
after amnesty was granted in 1880. They considered themselves
the heirs of Blanqui and the continuators of his
ideas; but under the political conditions of the Third Republic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
they brushed aside the secret practices of former
times and entered into politics as a distinct party with a
communist program. Their aim was also the conquest of
political power for the purpose of realizing a communistic
society and they approved of all means that would bring
about the realization of this end.</p>

<p>The group of Independent Socialists grew out of the
&#8220;Society for Social Economy&#8221; founded in 1885 by Malon,
once a member of the &#8220;International&#8221;. The &#8220;Society for
Social Economy&#8221; was organized for the purpose of elaborating
legislative projects of a general socialist character
which were published in the monthly of the Society, <i>La
Revue Socialiste</i>.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>  But the Society soon gained adherents
among advanced Republicans and Radicals and entered into
politics. It advocated the gradual nationalization of public
services, laws for the protection of labor, self-government
for the communes, etc. The party became an important
factor in the political life of France. Some of the best
known socialists of France have come from its ranks, as J.
Jaurès, Millerand, Viviani and others.</p>

<p>Amid these socialist factions, the syndicats were a coveted
bit torn to pieces because everybody wanted the larger
part of it. At their Congress of Paris (1883) the &#8220;Broussists&#8221;
adopted a resolution that &#8220;the members of the Party
will be bound to enter their syndical chamber or respective
trade group and to promote the creation of syndical chambers
and of trade groups where none exist as yet.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>  The
Guesdists in their turn had adopted a similar resolution
at their Congress in Roanne in 1882, and at their
succeeding Congress, in Roubaix (1884), they adopted a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
resolution to promote &#8220;as soon as possible the formation
of national federations of trades which should rescue the
isolated syndicats from their fatal weakness.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>  When the
Allemanists separated from the Broussists, they, in their
turn, made it obligatory for members of their party to belong
to their respective syndicats.</p>

<p>These acts, while promoting the organization of the syndicats,
impressed upon the latter a political character. The
syndicats were utilized for electoral purposes, were made to
serve the interests of the socialist group to which they adhered,
and were drawn into the whirlpool of political dissensions
and rivalry. The effect was destructive for the
syndicats. The acrimonious and personal polemics of the
socialist leaders bred ill-feeling among their workingmen
followers; the invective and abuse filling the periodical literature
of the socialist groups found an echo in the assemblies
of the workingmen; the mutual hatreds separating politically
Allemanists from Guesdists, Guesdists from anarchists,
were carried over into the syndicats which were hindered
thereby in their growth or entirely driven to disintegration.
The adherence of a syndicat to any one socialist group
generally repelled the non-socialists and enraged the adherents
of other socialist groups, and often led to the organization
of rival syndicats in the same trade and locality.
The literature of the French labor movement is full of instances
of the disorganizing effect which these political dissensions
exerted upon the syndicats.</p>

<p>Economic conditions, however, were impelling the workingmen
to union. Since the Commune, the industrial development
of France had gone on without interruption,
concentrating the economic powers of the employing
classes. In the face of the economic organizations of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
employers, the scattered and isolated syndicats were of little
significance, and the necessity of a larger combination made
itself felt. Besides, in 1884, a new law on syndicats was
passed. This law authorized the formation of syndicats
under certain conditions of which article 4 was obnoxious
to the workingmen. This article 4 of the new law made
it obligatory for every syndicat to send in the names and
addresses of its administrators to the municipal authorities.
In Paris they had to be sent to the Prefect of the
Police. The workingmen thought that this condition would
subject them to the mercy of the police and of the employers,
and they wanted to manifest their attitude to the new
law.</p>

<p>Under these conditions a general congress of syndicats
was called in Lyons in October, 1886. Organized workingmen
of various political opinions met here and at once
the sentiments and needs which brought them together
found expression in the report of the Committee on Organization
from which the following lines may be quoted:</p>

<blockquote><p>We are organized workingmen who have made a study of
social problems and who have recognized that the diversity
of doctrines contributes powerfully to divide us instead of
uniting us.</p>

<p>Slaves of the same master, bearing the same claims, suffering
from the same evils, having the same aspirations, the
same needs and the same rights, we have decided to set aside
our political and other preferences, to march hand in hand,
and to combine our forces against the common enemy. The
problems of labor have always the power of uniting the workingmen.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The first question on the program of the Congress was
the &#8220;prospect of a Federation of all workingmen's syndicats.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
The discussion brought out the fact that the delegates
had different ideas on the future rôle of the Federation.
Still the majority united on the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote><p>Considering that in face of the powerful bourgeois organization
made without and against the working-class, it not only
behooves, but it is the duty of the latter to create, by all means
possible, groupings and organizations of workingmen against
those of the bourgeois, for defense first, and we hope for
offensive action soon afterwards;</p>

<p>Considering that every organization of workingmen which
is not imbued with the distinction of classes, by the very fact
of the economic and political conditions of existing society,
and which exist only for the sake of giving assent to the will
of the government and of the bourgeoisie, or of presenting
petty observations of a respectful and therefore of a humiliating
nature for the dignity of the working-class, cannot be considered
as part of the workingmen's armies marching to the
conquest of their rights; for these reasons,</p>

<p>A National Federation is founded....<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The aim of the Federation was to help individual syndicats
in their struggles with employers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The National Federation of Syndicats,&#8221; however, did
not achieve its end. It soon fell into the hands of the
Guesdists who utilized the organization for political and
electoral purposes. The Congresses of the &#8220;National Federation
of Syndicats&#8221; were held in the same place and
about the same time as were those of the <i>Parti Ouvrier</i>,
were composed of the same men and passed the same resolutions.
Besides, the &#8220;National Federation of Syndicats&#8221;
never succeeded in establishing connections between the
local syndicats and the central organization (the <i>Conseil
fédéral national</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> and could, therefore, exert little economic
influence.</p>

<p>While the &#8220;National Federation of Syndicats&#8221; became
a war-engine at the service of the Guesdists,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>  another central
organization was created by the rivals of the Guesdists.
This was the &#8220;Federation of Labor Exchanges of France&#8221;
(<i>Fédération des Bourses du Travail de France</i>). The idea
of the <i>Bourse du Travail</i> may be traced back to the middle
of the nineteenth century and even further back to the
Great Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>  At first the idea was to erect a building
where the workingmen in need of work and the employers
in need of workingmen could meet. It was proposed that
the prevailing rate of wages in each industry be published
there day by day and that the quotations of the <i>Bourse du
Travail</i> then be inserted in the newspapers.... It was
expected that the workingmen of an entire country, even of
an entire continent would be enabled in this manner to
know, day by day, the places where work might be obtained
under the most favorable conditions, and where they
might choose to go to demand it.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>  But after the law of
1884 which legalized the syndicats, the <i>Bourse du Travail</i>
was conceived in a larger spirit, as a center where all the
syndicats of a locality could have their headquarters, arrange
meetings, give out information, serve as bureaus of
employment, organize educational courses, have their libraries
and bring the workingmen of all trades into contact
with one another. The municipalities were to promote
their creation and to subsidize them.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
The first <i>Bourse du Travail</i> was opened in Paris in 1887.
The example of Paris was followed by other municipalities
of France, and in a short time many of the larger cities
of France had their <i>Bourses du Travail</i>. The Allemanists
obtained the predominating influence in the <i>Bourses du
Travail</i>, and they conceived the idea of opposing to the
&#8220;National Federation of Syndicats&#8221;&mdash;which was an instrument
in the hands of the Guesdists&mdash;a &#8220;Federation of
<i>Bourses du Travail</i>,&#8221; in which they would have the leading
part.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>  The &#8220;Federation of <i>Bourses du Travail</i>&#8221; was organized
in 1892 with the following program: (1) To unify
the demands of the workingmen's syndicats and to bring
about the realization of these demands; (2) To extend and
to propagate the action of the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>, in
the industrial and agricultural centers; (3) To nominate
delegates to the National Secretariat of Labor; (4) To collect
statistical data and to communicate them to the adhering
Bourses, and at the same time to generalize the gratuitous
service of finding employment for workers of both
sexes and of all trades.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The &#8220;National Secretariat of Labor&#8221; mentioned was
created after the International Socialist Congress of Brussels
in 1891. The Congress of Brussels had proposed to
create in all countries National Secretariats in order to
unify the labor and socialist movement of the world. In
France, the National Secretariat of Labor soon experienced
the fate of other organizations. In view of political differences,
it was abandoned by the Guesdists, Independents,
and Broussists. It therefore could not achieve the aim it
had in view and lost all significance.</p>

<p>Into this situation there now entered another factor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
which was to determine the course of further groupings.
This factor was the idea of the general strike. The idea
was not new in the history of the labor movement and not
original with France. It had been widely discussed in England
during the 30's<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>  and afterwards at the Congresses of
the &#8220;International&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>  It reappeared in France in the second
half of the 80's and seems to have been suggested by
the wide strike movement in America during 1886-7. Its
first propagandist in France seems to have been a French
anarchist workingman, Tortelier, a member of the syndicat
of carpenters.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The idea of the general strike was hailed enthusiastically
by the French syndicats. On the one hand it seemed to
give the workingmen a new weapon in their economic
struggles. It was seen above how reluctant French workingmen
had been to use the strike during the 60's and 70's.
Though forced by economic conditions to use it, the French
workingmen still considered it a necessary evil which never
fully rewarded the sacrifices it involved. The general
strike seemed to repair the defects of the partial strike.
It seemed to insure success by increasing the number of
strikers and by extending the field of disturbance. On the
other hand, the general strike suggested itself as a method
of bringing about the Social Revolution. This question
was a vital one with the socialist syndicats. It was much
debated and discussed and divided deeply the adherents of
the various socialist and anarchist groups. &#8220;The conquest
of political power,&#8221; the method advocated by Guesdists and
others, seemed vague and indefinitely remote; a general revolt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
such as advocated by the anarchists, seemed impossible
in view of the new armaments and of the new construction
of cities which made barricades and street fighting
a thing of the past. These two methods eliminated, the
general strike seemed to present the only and proper weapon
in the hands of the workingmen for the realization of their
final emancipation.</p>

<p>In this sense, the principle of the general strike was
voted for the first time in 1888 at the Congress of the &#8220;National
Federation of Syndicats&#8221; in Bordeaux. The idea
spread rapidly. The Allemanists declared in favor of it
at their Congresses in 1891 and 1892.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>  Fernand Pelloutier,
of whom more will be said in the next chapter, defended
it successfully before a socialist congress in Tours in 1892.
The same year, Aristide Briand appeared as the eloquent
champion of the general strike before the Congress of the
&#8220;National Federation of Syndicats&#8221; in Marseilles.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>  The
Blanquists admitted the general strike as one of the possible
revolutionary means. Only the Guesdists were
against the general strike and at their Congress in Lille
(1890) declared it impossible.</p>

<p>The conception of the general strike that prevailed during
this period was that of a peaceful cessation of work.
The strike, it was agreed, is a right guaranteed by law.
Even if a strike were to spread to many industries and assume
a general character, the workingmen would still be
exercising their rights and could not be lawfully prosecuted.
The general strike, therefore, would enable the workingmen
to carry out a Revolution by legal means and would
make the revolution an easy matter. The general strike
must mean revolution because a complete cessation of work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
would paralyze the life of the country and would reduce
the ruling classes to famine. Lasting a few days only, it
would compel the government to capitulate before the workingmen,
and would carry the workingmen's party into
power. Thus, a &#8220;peaceful strike of folded arms&#8221; (<i>grève
des bras croisés</i>) would usher in the Social Revolution
which would bring about the transformation of society.
The feeling prevailed that the general strike could begin
any moment and that it assured the speedy realization of
the socialist ideal. At first it was thought that the general
strike could be organized or decreed, but this idea was soon
given up, and the general strike came to be thought of as
a spontaneous movement which might be hastened only by
propaganda and organization.</p>

<p>The conception of the general strike involved one more
important point. It implied the superior value of the economic
method of organization and struggle over the political.
The general strike is a phenomenon of economic life
and must be based on an economic organization of the
working-class.</p>

<p>On this conception of the general strike the Guesdists
threw themselves with all the subtlety of their dialectics.
They asserted that the idyllic picture of the social revolution
was too puerile to be taken seriously; that before the
capitalists felt the pangs of hunger, the workingmen would
already have starved.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>  They insisted that no such peaceful
general strike was possible: that either the workingmen
would lose their composure, or the government would provoke
a collision. On the other hand, they affirmed that a
successful general strike presupposes a degree of organization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and solidarity among workingmen which, if realized,
would make the general strike itself unnecessary. But,
above all, they argued that the general strike could not be
successful, because in the economic field the workingmen
are weaker than the capitalists and cannot hope to win;
that only in the political field are the workingmen equal,
and even superior to the employers, because they are the
greater number. The conclusion, therefore, was that &#8220;the
general strike is general nonsense&#8221; and that the only hope
of the workingmen lay in the conquest of political power.
The syndicat could only have a secondary and limited importance
in the struggle for emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The attitude of the Guesdists towards the general
strike brought them into conflict with the &#8220;National Federation
of Syndicats&#8221; which voted in favor of the general
strike at Marseilles in 1892. The conflict at first was
latent, but soon led to a split in the &#8220;National Federation
of Syndicats&#8221; and to a readjustment of the various elements
of the syndicats. This took place in the following
way.</p>

<p>In 1893 the <i>Bourse du Travail</i> of Paris was authorized
by the Second Congress of the &#8220;Federation of Bourses&#8221;
to call a general trade-union Congress in which all syndicats
should take part. The Congress was to convene the
18th of July, 1893. About ten days before this, the government
closed the <i>Bourse du Travail</i> of Paris. The reason
given was that the syndicats adhering to the Bourse
had not conformed to the law of 1884. This act of the
government provoked an agitation among the workingmen,
the Congress took on a character of protest, and a large
number of syndicats wished to be represented.</p>

<p>The Congress of Paris adopted the principle of the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
strike by vote, but in view of governmental persecution,
the necessity of unifying the forces of the workingmen
was thought to be the most important question. It
was discussed at length, and the Congress adopted a resolution,
that all existing syndicats, within the shortest
possible time, should join the Federation of their trade or
constitute such a federation if none as yet existed; that
they should form themselves into local federations or
<i>Bourses du Travail</i> and that these Federations and
<i>Bourses du Travail</i> should form a &#8220;National Federation,&#8221;
and the Congress invited the &#8220;Federation of Bourses du
Travail&#8221; and the &#8220;National Federation of Syndicats&#8221; to
merge into one organization.</p>

<p>The Congress of Paris also called a general Congress of
syndicats for the following year in Nantes and commissioned
the <i>Bourse du Travail</i> of Nantes to arrange the
Congress. The &#8220;Bourse&#8221; of Nantes had already received
a mandate from the &#8220;National Federation of Syndicats&#8221;
to arrange its Congress. It therefore decided to arrange
both Congresses at the same time and to make one Congress
out of two. The National Council of the &#8220;Federation
of Syndicats&#8221;, where the Guesdists presided, protested,
but with no result. A general Congress of syndicats
was held in Nantes in 1894.</p>

<p>By this time the number of syndicats in France had considerably
increased. According to the <i>Annuaire Statistique</i>,
the growth of the syndicats since 1884 was as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>Of these, 1,662 syndicats were represented at the Congress
of Nantes. This fact shows how keen was the interest
felt in the idea of the general strike which, it was
known, was to be the main question at the Congress.</p>

<p>The Congress of Nantes adopted a motion in favor of
the general strike, appointed a &#8220;Committee for the propaganda
of the general strike&#8221; and authorized this committee
to collect 10 per cent of all subscriptions for strikes.
The Guesdist delegates after this vote left the Congress and
held a separate Congress by themselves.</p>

<p>The majority of the delegates remained and voted the
creation of a &#8220;National Council&#8221; which should form the
central organization of all the syndicats of France.</p>

<p>The &#8220;National Council&#8221; functioned unsatisfactorily.
At the next general Congress in Limoges (1895) the &#8220;National
Council&#8221; was abolished and the foundations of a
new organization were laid. This new organization was
the &#8220;General Confederation of Labor&#8221;.</p>

<p>The workingman had come to recognize that political
divisions were disastrous to the growth of the syndicats.
The elimination of politics from the syndicats was, therefore,
adopted at Limoges as a condition of admission to
the &#8220;General Confederation&#8221;. The first article of the Statutes
read:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
Among the various syndicats and associations of syndicats
of workingmen and of employees of both sexes existing in
France and in its Colonies, there is hereby created a uniform
and collective organization with the name General Confederation
of Labor.</p>

<p>The elements constituting the General Confederation of
Labor will remain independent of all political schools (<i>en
dehors de toute école politique</i>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The aim of the Confederation was evidently formulated
to satisfy all conceptions. Its vague wording was as follows:
&#8220;The General Confederation of Labor has the exclusive
purpose of uniting the workingmen, in the economic
domain and by bonds of close solidarity, in the struggle for
their integral emancipation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The &#8220;General Confederation of Labor&#8221; incorporated the
general strike as part of its program.</p>

<p>The creation of the &#8220;General Confederation of Labor&#8221;
may be considered the first important manifestation of the
revolutionary tendency in the syndical movement of France.
As Mr. Leon de Seilhac justly remarks, &#8220;the Congress of
Limoges was a victory of the syndicalist revolutionary party
over the syndicalist party of politics (<i>Parti syndical politicien</i>).&#8221;
The victory was on the side of those who hailed
the general strike, who asserted the superiority of economic
action over political and who wanted to keep the syndicats
independent of the political parties. These ideas contained
the germ of revolutionary syndicalism and the Allemanists
who emphasized them before others may thus be said to
have pointed out the lines along which revolutionary syndicalism
was to develop.</p>

<p>The &#8220;General Confederation of Labor&#8221;, however, was
not founded by Allemanists alone. Its organization was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
advocated by Blanquists and non-socialist workingmen.
The Blanquists had always insisted upon the necessity of
an independent economic organization and had refused to
admit syndicats into their political organizations as constituent
elements. The non-socialist workingmen, on the
other hand, contributed to the foundation of the &#8220;General
Confederation&#8221; because they felt the economic importance
of a central syndical organization.</p>

<p>The &#8220;General Confederation of Labor&#8221; took the place
of the &#8220;National Federation of Syndicats&#8221;. The Guesdists
that had split off at the Congress of Nantes continued
for some time to bear the title of &#8220;National Federation of
Syndicats&#8221;, but their organization was of no importance
and was soon lost in the general organization of the <i>Parti
Ouvrier</i>.</p>

<p>The &#8220;National Secretariat of Labor&#8221; died a quiet death
(in 1896), after having expended the little energy it had.
There were, therefore, now two central organizations: (1)
The General Confederation of Labor, and (2) The Federation
of Bourses du Travail. In these the further history
of syndicalism centers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Federation of Bourses du Travail.</span> (1892-1902)</h2>

<p>The <i>Bourses du Travail</i> met an important want in the
syndical life of France. The local syndicats were generally
poor and could accomplish but little in their isolation. The
<i>Bourse du Travail</i> furnished them with a center where they
could easily come to a common understanding and plan
common action.</p>

<p>The first <i>Bourse du Travail</i>, as indicated above, was
opened by the Municipal Council of Paris in 1887. In 1892
there were already fourteen Bourses in existence. Their
number increased as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="10" summary="Table 4">

<tr><td align="center">1900</td><td align="center">75</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1902</td><td align="center">96</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Outside of Paris, the initiative of creating a <i>Bourse du
Travail</i> was generally taken by the workingmen themselves.
The local syndicats would elect a committee to work out
statutes and a table of probable expenses and income. The
project of the committee would then be submitted to the
general assembly of the syndicats. The assembly would
also elect an administrative council, a secretary, treasurer
and other officers. The statutes, the list of adhering syndicats,
and the names of the administrative officers would
then be presented to the municipal authorities, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<i>Bourse du Travail</i>, which in fact was a local federation of
unions, would be formally constituted.</p>

<p>In many places, local federations existed before 1887.
These simply had to assume the new title to transform
themselves into <i>Bourses du Travail</i>. The municipalities
would then intervene and grant a subvention. Up to 1902
inclusive, the municipalities of France spent 3,166,159
francs in installing <i>Bourses du Travail</i>, besides giving the
annual subventions. In 1902, the subvention received by
all the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> of France from the municipalities
amounted to 197,345 francs, and 48,550 francs besides
were contributed to their budget by the Departments.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>  The
readiness of the municipal councils to subsidize the <i>Bourses
du Travail</i> was due mostly, if not always, to political considerations.</p>

<p>Though soliciting subventions from the municipalities,
the syndicats insisted on being absolutely independent in
the administration of the Bourses. The first Congress of
the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> in 1892 declared that:</p>

<blockquote><p>Whereas the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> must be absolutely independent
in order to render the services which are expected
from them;</p>

<p>Whereas this institution constitutes the only reform which
the workingmen have wrested from the ruling class;</p>

<p>The Congress of <i>Bourses du Travail</i> of 1892 declares that
the workingmen must reject absolutely the meddling of the
administrative and governmental authorities in the functioning
of the Bourses,&mdash;an interference which was manifested in the
declaration of public utility;</p>

<p>Invites the workingmen to make the most energetic efforts
in order to guarantee the entire independence of the <i>Bourses
du Travail</i>, and to refuse the municipalities if they or the government
desire to interfere with their functioning.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The municipalities, on the contrary, wanted to have some
control over the funds they furnished. The result was
more or less friction. In 1894, the Congress of the <i>Bourses
du Travail</i> decided to demand that the Bourses be declared
institutions of public utility; this, it was thought, would put
them under the protection of the law and make impossible
any hostile act on the part of the administration. But the
next year the fourth Congress of the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>
reversed the decision of the preceding Congress and declared
for complete independence.</p>

<p>As the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> became more aggressive, the
difficulties with regard to the municipalities increased. At
the fifth congress of the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> (1896) in
Tours, a report was presented showing the Bourses how
they could exist without the subvention of the municipalities.
The question of financial independence was brought
up at later Congresses, but received no solution. The
Bourses could not live on their own resources, while they
continued the activities which brought them now and then
into conflict with the municipal authorities.</p>

<p>The program which the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> gradually
outlined for themselves has been classified under four
heads: (1) Benevolent Services, or as the French term it
<i>Mutualité</i>; (2) <i>Instruction</i>; (3) <i>Propaganda</i>; and (4) <i>Resistance</i>.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The services of <i>Mutualité</i> included finding employment
for workingmen out of work (<i>Placement</i>), assistance to
workmen who go from city to city in search of employment
(<i>Viaticum</i>), aid to other unemployed persons, sick
benefit, etc. The Bourses paid particular attention to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
service of <i>placement</i>. Pelloutier, the Secretary of the Federation
of Bourses, wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Placement is in fact the first and greatest advantage which
the federative grouping can offer to the workingmen, and it
constitutes a powerful instrument of recruiting. In consequence
of the instability of employment, the use of private employment
bureaus for whose services payment has to be made, soon becomes
so onerous that many workingmen exasperated by the
necessity of deducting from their future wages (which are
more and more reduced) considerable tithes for the services
of employment bureaus, prefer often&mdash;though losing thereby&mdash;to
spend their time in search of a place which will secure a
livelihood. Besides, it is known&mdash;and the proceedings of Parliament
have furnished decisive proof&mdash;that the habitual practice
of the employment bureaus is to procure the most precarious
employments so as to multiply the number of visits
which the workingmen will have to pay them. It is therefore
easy to understand the readiness with which the unfortunates
go to the <i>Bourse du Travail</i>, which offers desired employment
gratuitously. In this manner men who would hold
aloof from the syndicats out of ignorance or indifference, enter
them under the pressure of need and find there instruction,
the utility and importance of which escaped them before.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The services of instruction comprised the founding of
libraries, the organization of technical courses, the arrangement
of lectures on general subjects (economic, literary,
historical, etc.), workingmen's journals, bureaus of information,
etc.</p>

<p>The propaganda of the Bourses had for its general aim
the intellectual development of the workingman and the
extension of the syndical movement. The Bourses were
to support the syndicats in existence, organize new ones,
promote the adherence of single syndicats to their national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
federations, carry on a propaganda among the agricultural
laborers and perform other functions of a similar character.</p>

<p>The services of resistance consisted in lending material
and moral aid to the workingmen in their economic struggles.
The Bourses regarded themselves mainly as societies
of resistance whose principal function was to support the
workingmen in struggle. The other functions were considered
subordinate to this main service.</p>

<p>Every Bourse carried out this program only in proportion
to its means. The Bourses differed a great deal in
number of adherents, in financial resources, in command of
organizers, etc. Some consisted of a few syndicats with a
few dozen members only; others comprised tens of syndicats
with thousands of organized workingmen and with a
budget running into the thousands.</p>

<p>A few figures may help to form some idea of the extent
of the services rendered by the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> during
the period considered in this chapter. The number of positions
filled by the Bourses were as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="10" summary="Table 5">

<tr><td align="center"><i>Year</i></td><td align="center"><i>Applications for employment</i></td><td align="center"><i>Offers of employment</i></td><td align="center"><i>Placed at residence</i></td><td align="center"><i>Placed away from residence</i></td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The service of <i>viaticum</i> was organized differently by
different Bourses. Some paid one franc a day, others one
and one-half and two francs. In many Bourses the traveling
workingmen received part only of the <i>viaticum</i> in
money, the rest in kind (tickets to restaurants, lodging,
etc.). The reports of the Bourses presented to their Congress
at Paris in 1900, contain some information on the
subject. The Bourse of Alger spent from 600 to 700
francs a year on the service of <i>viaticum</i>. The Bourse of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Bordeaux distributed during certain months about 130
francs, during others, only 60; other Bourses spent much
less. The following table presents the amounts spent in
successive years by the Bourse of Rennes:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="10" summary="Table 6">

<tr><td align="left">1898 (till Sept.)</td><td align="center">32</td><td align="center">64</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In organizing technical courses, the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>
pursued the aim of fighting &#8220;the dominant tendency in
modern industry to make of the child a laborer, an unconscious
accessory of the machine, instead of making him an
intelligent collaborator.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>  Again in this respect the services
of the Bourses varied. In the Bourse of Etienne,
597 courses of two hours each were attended by 426 pupils
from October 1, 1899, to June 30, 1911. The Bourse of
Marseilles had in 1900 courses in carpentry, metallurgy,
typography and others. The Bourse of Toulouse organized
20 courses and had its own typographical shop.</p>

<p>Nearly all Bourses organized their own libraries, some
of which consisted of several hundred volumes, while the
library of the <i>Bourse du Travail</i> of Paris contained over
2,000 volumes. Besides, every large Bourse had its periodical,
weekly or monthly.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Fédération des Bourses du Travail</i> was formed
in 1892 to systematize and to unify the activities of the
Bourses. Though it owed its origin to political motives,
the Federation soon devoted its main energies to the economic
functions of the Bourses which it tried to extend and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to strengthen. This turn in its policy the Federation owed
chiefly to Fernand Pelloutier, who became secretary of the
Federation in 1894 and who remained in this post till his
death in 1901.</p>

<p>Fernand Pelloutier (1867-1901) came from a bourgeois
family and was educated in a Catholic school.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>  He
entered political life at an early age in a provincial town
(St. Nazaire), as an advanced republican, but soon passed
into the socialist ranks. Though a member of the <i>Parti
Ouvrier</i> (Guesdists), he defended the general strike in
1892 before a socialist Congress in Tours. This caused
his break with the <i>Parti Ouvrier</i>. In 1893 he came to
Paris and here came under the influence of the Anarchist-Communists,
whose ideas he fully accepted and professed
to his last day.</p>

<p>Pelloutier was appointed secretary of the Federation of
Bourses in order to assure the political neutrality of the organization.
As indicated in the previous chapter, the Federation
owed its birth largely to the political interests of the
Allemanists. The Federation, however, soon found itself
composed of various elements&mdash;Blanquists, Guesdists, etc.&mdash;but
the economic interests which stimulated the growth
of the Bourses were strong enough to create a desire on the
part of the workingmen to avoid political dissensions and
quarrels. An anarchist at the head of the Federation
seemed to guarantee the necessary neutrality.</p>

<p>Fernand Pelloutier realized the expectations placed in
him. He was disgusted with politics and his &#8220;dream was
to oppose a strong, powerful economic action to political
action.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>  The Federation of Bourses became his absorbing
interest in life. To it he devoted most of his time and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
energy. He proved himself a man of steady purpose, of
methodical procedure, and of high organizing abilities. He
has been recognized as the most able organizer of the working
class that modern France has produced. His services
to the development of the syndicalist movement have
been recognized by men of various opinions and political
convictions. M. Seilhac wrote of him in 1897, &#8220;a young
man, intelligent, educated, sprung from the bourgeoisie,
has just entered the Federation as Secretary; M. F. Pelloutier
has led the Federation with a talent and a surety of
judgment which his most implacable enemies must acknowledge.
Having passed through the &#8216;Guesdist&#8217; school, M.
Pelloutier violently broke away from this intolerant and
despotic party and was attracted by pure anarchism. The
Federation owes its rapid success in great measure to
him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>In 1892 the Federation was formed by ten Bourses out
of the fourteen then in existence. Its growth was as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="10" summary="Table 7">
<tr><td align="center"><i>Year</i></td><td align="center"><i>Bourses</i></td><td align="center"><i>Syndicats</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1895</td><td align="center">34</td><td align="center">606</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">1902</td><td align="center">83</td><td align="center">1,112</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The Federation was represented by a Federal Committee
in Paris. Each Bourse had the right to a delegate in the
Committee, but a single delegate could represent several
Bourses. As the Federal Committee was in Paris, the delegates
were not members of the Bourses they represented.
They were chosen by the Bourses from a list sent to them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
by the Secretary of the Federation and made up of men
either personally known by him or recommended to him.
This gave rise to dissatisfaction, and it was decided that
the secretary should complete the list of candidates with
remarks on their political attachments, so that the Bourses
might choose representatives expressing exactly their opinions.</p>

<p>In this way the Federal Committee came to be composed
of various political elements. In 1899 there were 48
Bourses in the Federation; of these three were represented
in the Federal Committee by Blanquists, eleven by Allemanists,
five by Guesdists. The last named soon left the
Federation; the rest did not adhere to any party. &#8220;Within
the group of their representatives particularly,&#8221; wrote
Pelloutier, &#8220;must one look for those convinced libertarians<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
whom the Bourses have maintained as delegates regardless
of the reproaches of certain socialist schools, and
who, without fuss, have done so much for some years to
enhance the individual energy and the development of the
syndicats.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>  The Committee had no executive officers, not
even a chairman. The business was done by the secretary,
an assistant secretary and a treasurer. The first received
1,200 francs a year. Each session began with the reading
of the minutes of the preceding session, and of the correspondence;
then the discussion of the questions raised by the
correspondence, inscribed on the order of the day, or raised
by the delegates, occurred. A vote took place only in cases,
&#8220;extremely rare&#8221;, when an irreconciliable divergence of
views sprang up. The meetings took place twice a month.</p>

<p>Pelloutier wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>The suppression of the chairmanship and of useless voting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
dates only from the entrance of the libertarians into the Committee,
but experience soon convinced all members that between
serious and disinterested men there is no necessity of
a monitor because everyone considers it an honor to respect the
freedom of discussion and even, (without wavering from his
principles) to conduct the debate in a conversational tone.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Federal Committee proceeded in a methodical way.
Between 1894-1896 it devoted itself mainly to propaganda
and to organization. It invited the local syndicats and
unions of syndicats to constitute themselves into <i>Bourses
du Travail</i>. To guide them Pelloutier wrote a little pamphlet
on <i>The method of organizing and maintaining Bourses
du Travail</i>. After 1895 the Federal Committee thought
the multiplication of Bourses too rapid. The Committee
feared that the Bourses were constituting themselves without
sufficient syndical strength and that they were putting
themselves at the mercy of a dissolution or of an unsuccessful
strike.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Committee, therefore, thought it wise if not to moderate
the organizing enthusiasm of the militant workingmen, at
least to call their attention to the utility of extending to arrondissements,
sometimes even to an entire department, a propaganda
which was till then limited to a local circle. Two or
three Bourses per Department, wrote Pelloutier, would group
the workingmen more rapidly and at the cost of less efforts
than seven or eight insufficiently equipped and necessarily
weak.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 1897, at the Congress of Toulouse, Pelloutier read
two reports in which he invited the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> to
extend their activities to the agricultural population and to
the sailors. These reports reveal a thorough study of the
conditions in which these two classes of the population
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
spend their lives, and contain indications how to attract
them to syndical activity. Pelloutier recommended the
Bourses to create commissions which should be specially
devoted to agricultural problems and which should train
propagandists for the country. He also recommended the
institution of homes for sailors in the ports.</p>

<p>Some Bourses acted on the suggestion of Pelloutier and
since then dates the propaganda carried on by some Bourses
among the wood-cutters, the wine-growers, the agricultural
laborers, the fishermen, sailors and similar groups of the
working population.</p>

<p>From 1898 to 1900 the Federal Committee was trying
to systematize the services of the <i>placement</i> and of the
<i>viaticum</i>. The suggestion came from some Bourses, which
particularly felt this necessity. Some Bourses had already
been placing workingmen at a distance through correspondence.
They wanted to generalize this by having the Federal
Committee publish statistics of the fluctuations of employment
in the various Bourses. On the other hand, the
Bourses had difficulties with the service of <i>viaticum</i>. The
diversity of conditions in this respect gave rise to dissatisfaction,
while the Bourses were unable to control abuses.
The secretaries could not know the number of visits paid
them by workingmen, nor the amounts received by each.</p>

<p>At the Congress of Rennes (1898), the Federal Committee
presented a plan of a &#8220;federal viaticum&#8221;, and in
1900, the <i>Office national de statistique et de placement</i> was
organized. The &#8220;federal viaticum&#8221; was optional for members
of the federation, and though presenting certain advantages
for the Bourses, was accepted by very few of
them. Organized in 1899, it functioned unsatisfactorily.</p>

<p>The <i>Office national</i> began activity in June, 1900. It
was organized with the financial aid of the government.
In 1900, after the Universal Exhibition, Paris was overcrowded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
with unemployed workingmen, and the government
thought it could make use of the Federation of
Bourses to disperse them over the country. Before that, in
November, 1899, the Federal Committee had addressed the
government for a subsidy of 10,000 francs to organize the
<i>Office national</i>. In June, 1900, the Government granted
5,000 francs. The <i>Office</i> began to publish a weekly
statistical bulletin containing the information on the fluctuation
of employment sent to the Federal Committee by the
Bourses. The <i>Office</i>, however, did not give the expected
results. In organizing these services, the Federation of
Bourses always kept in mind the interests of the syndicats.
It directed workingmen to employers who satisfied the general
conditions imposed by the syndicats. The <i>viaticum</i>
also served to diminish competition among workingmen in
ordinary times, or during strikes.</p>

<p>In all its activity the Federal Committee generally followed
the same policy. It called the attention of one Bourse
to the experiments and to the achievements of others; it
made its own suggestions and recommendations and it carried
out the decisions of the Congresses. It did not regard
itself as a central organ with power to command. Constituted
on a federalist basis, the Bourses expected from
the Federal Committee merely the preliminary study of
problems of a common interest, reserving for themselves
the right to reject both the problems and the study; they
considered even their Congresses merely as <i>foyers</i> where
the instruments of discussion and of work were forged.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The activity of the Federal Committee was handicapped
by insufficiency of means. The financial state of the Federation
between 1892 and 1902 may be gathered from the
following table:

<p>The Bourses paid their dues irregularly and Pelloutier
complained that with such means the Committee could not
render all the services it was capable of and that it was
necessarily reduced to the rôle of a correspondence bureau,
&#8220;slow and imperfect in its working.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whatever others may have thought of the results obtained
by the Federation of Bourses, the leaders themselves
felt enthusiastic about the things accomplished. Pelloutier
wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Enumerate the results obtained by the groupings of workingmen;
consult the program, of the courses instituted by the
<i>Bourses du Travail</i>, a program which omits nothing which
goes to make up a moral, complete, dignified and satisfied life;
regard the authors who inhabit the workingmen's libraries;
admire this syndical and co-operative organization which extends
from day to day and embraces new categories of producers,
the unification of all the proletarian forces into a
close network of syndicats, of co-operative societies, of
leagues of resistance; consider the constantly increasing intervention
into the diverse manifestations of social life; the
examination of methods of production and of distribution
and say whether this organization, whether this program, this
tendency towards the beautiful and the good, whether this
aspiration toward the complete expansion of the individual do
not justify the pride the Bourses du Travail feel.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>This feeling and the preoccupation with socialist ideals
led Pelloutier and other members of the Federation to
think that the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> could not only render
immediate services, but that they were capable of &#8220;adapting
themselves to a superior social order&#8221;. Pelloutier
thought that the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> were evolving from
this time on the elements of a new society, that they were
gradually constituting a veritable socialist (economic and
anarchic) state within the bourgeois state,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>  and that they
would, in time, substitute communistic forms of production
and of distribution for those now in existence. The question
was brought up for discussion at the Congress of
Tours (1896) and two reports were read on the present
and future rôle of the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>. One report
was written by Pelloutier, the other was prepared by the
delegates of the Bourse of Nimes, Claude Gignoux and
Victorien Briguier (Allemanists).</p>

<p>The report of the Bourse of Nimes starts out from the
idea that no new plan of a future society need be fabricated;
that the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> show themselves already
capable of directing the economic activities of society and
that with further growth they will become more and more
capable of so doing. The natural development of the
Bourses, it held, leads them to investigate the number of
unemployed in each trade; the causes of industrial perturbation,
the cost of maintenance of each individual in comparison
with wages received; the number of trades and of
workingmen employed in them; the amount of the produce;
the totality of products necessary for the population of their
region, etc., etc. Now, it further set forth, with all this
information at hand, and with all this economic experience,
each Bourse could, in case of a social transformation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
assume the direction of the industrial life of its region.
Each trade organized in a syndicat would elect a council
of labor; the syndicats of the same trade would be federated
nationally and internationally. The Bourses, knowing
the quantity of products which must be produced, would impart
this information to the councils of labor of each trade,
which employ all members of the trade in the manufacture
of necessary products. By their statistics, the Bourses
would know where there is excess or want of production in
their regions, and would determine the exchange of products
between the territories which by nature are adapted
for some special production only. The report presupposed
that property would become &#8220;social and inalienable&#8221;; and
the assumption was that the workingmen would be stimulated
to develop the industrial powers of their regions and
to increase the material welfare of the country. The report
concluded:</p>

<blockquote><p>This summary outline gives those who live in the syndical
movement an idea of the rôle which falls and will fall to the
<i>Bourses du Travail</i>. It would not do to hurry decisions; the
methodical pursuit of the development of our institutions is
sufficient to realize our aim, and to avoid many disappointments
and retrogressions. It is for us, who have inherited
the thought and the science of all those who have come before
us, to bring it about that so many riches and so much
welfare due to their genius should not serve to engender
misery and injustice, but should establish harmony of interests
on equality of rights and on the solidarity of all human
beings.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The report of the Federal Committee, prepared by Pelloutier,
contained the same ideas but emphasized some other
points. &#8220;We start out from the principle,&#8221; read this report,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
&#8220;that the task of the revolution is to free mankind
not only from all authority (<i>autorité</i>), but also from every
institution which has not for its essential purpose the development
of production. Consequently, we can imagine
the future society only as a voluntary and free association
of producers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>  In this social system the syndicats and
the Bourses are to play the part assigned to them in the
report of the Bourse of Nimes.</p>

<blockquote><p>The consequence of this new state, of this suppression of useless
social organs, of this simplification of necessary machinery,
will be that man will produce better, more and quicker;
that he will be able, therefore, to devote long hours to his intellectual
development, to accelerate in this way mechanical
progress, to free himself more and more from painful work,
and to arrange his life in greater conformity to his instinctive
aspirations toward studious repose.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pelloutier laid emphasis on the idea that this future state
was being gradually prepared and was dependent upon the
intellectual and moral development of the working-class; he
conceived it as a gradual substitution of institutions evolved
by the working-class for those institutions which characterize
existing society. He believed that the syndicalist
life was the only means of stimulating the power and the
initiative of the workingmen and of developing their administrative
abilities. His report, quoted above, concluded:
&#8220;And this is the future in store for the working-class, if
becoming conscious of its intellectual faculties, and of its
dignity, it will come to draw only from within itself its
notion of social duty, will detest and break every authority
foreign to it and will finally conquer security and liberty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>This conception of the syndicat has since become fundamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
with revolutionary syndicalists. Formulating it, the
<i>Fédération des Bourses du Travail</i> really laid the foundations
of what later became revolutionary syndicalism.
The &#8220;Federation of Bourses&#8221; also made the first step in
the propaganda of anti-militarism and in outlining a policy
of opposition to the State. The latter ideas, however, were
at the same time developed in the General Confederation
of Labor and will be considered in connection with the history
of that body in the next chapter.</p>

<p>From 1894 to 1902 the <i>Fédération des Bourses du Travail</i>
was the strongest syndical organization in France.
Pelloutier claimed 250,000 members for it, but the figure
is exaggerated. There is no way, however, of finding out
the true figures.</p>

<p>Conscious of its comparative strength, the Federation of
Bourses at times ignored, at times dominated the General
Confederation of Labor. These two organizations were
rivals. The General Confederation of Labor had adopted
at Limoges (1895) statutes according to which the Confederation
could admit not only National Federations of Syndicats,
but single syndicats and single Bourses. This was
obnoxious to the Federation of Bourses. The latter wished
that the General Confederation should be composed exclusively
of two federal committees; one representing the Federation
of Bourses; the other representing the National
Federations of trade. Until this was accepted, the Federation
of Bourses, at its Congress in Tours (1896), refused
to give any financial aid to the General Confederation
in view &#8220;of the little vitality&#8221; which it displayed.</p>

<p>The General Confederation of Labor modified its statutes
year after year, but no harmony between the two organizations
could be established for some time. In 1897,
the Federation of Bourses joined the General Confederation,
but left it again in 1898.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The friction was due partly to personal difficulties, partly
to the differences of spirit which prevailed in the central
committees of the two organizations. After 1900, however,
the two organizations, though distinct, co-operated,
and the question of unifying the two organizations was
more and more emphasized. In 1902, at the Congress of
Montpellier, this unity was realized; the Federation of
Bourses entered the General Confederation of Labor, and
ceased to have a separate existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The General Confederation of Labor from 1895 to
1902</span></h2>

<p>The General Confederation of Labor has continued its
existence under the same name since its foundation in
1895. Still the period from 1895 to 1902 may be considered
separately for two reasons: first, during this
period the organization of the Confederation under
which it now functions was evolved;<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>  and secondly, during
this period the tendency known as revolutionary
syndicalism became definite and complete. This period
may be considered therefore as the formative period
both from the point of view of organization and from
the point of view of doctrine.</p>

<p>The gradual elaboration of organization and of doctrine
may best be considered from year to year. The
700 syndicats which formed the General Confederation
at Limoges in 1895 aimed to &#8220;establish among themselves
daily relations which would permit them to formulate
in common the demands studied individually;
they wanted also and particularly to put an end to the
disorganization which penetrated their ranks under cover
of the political spirit.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The Congress held the following year at Tours (1896)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
showed that the aim was not attained. Only 32 organizations
had paid the initiation fee (two francs) as requested
by the statutes adopted at Limoges. Of the 32
only four, the <i>Fédération des Travailleurs du Livre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>  the
Syndicat of Railway Men, the Circle of Machinists, and
the Federation of Porcelain Workers, paid their dues
regularly; the rest paid irregularly or did not pay at all.
The entire income for the year amounted to 740 francs.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The National Council of the Confederation did not
function because the number of delegates elected by the
adhering organizations was insufficient to constitute the
committees among which the work was to be divided.
The few delegates that did attend the meetings quarreled
for political and other reasons. The Federation of
Bourses showed itself hostile, because the statutes
adopted at Limoges admitted Bourses, single syndicats,
local and regional federations.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Committee for the propaganda of the General
Strike&#8221; could also report but little progress. The Committee
had been authorized by the Congress of Nantes
(1894) to collect 10 per cent of all subscriptions for
strikes. The Committee, however, reported to the Congress
of Tours, that the syndicats and Bourses did not
live up to the decision. From December 1, 1894, to
September 12, 1892, 329 francs 75 centimes was collected;
for 1895-96, 401 francs 95 centimes. With such
limited means but little headway could be made.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The Congress of Tours tried to remedy the situation
by making several changes in the statutes. Single
Bourses were not to be admitted. This was a concession
to the Federation of Bourses, which was invited to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
join the Confederation; single syndicats were to be admitted
only if there were no national federations in their
trades. Each National Federation of trade or of industry
could send three delegates to the National Council;
syndicats and local federations, only one. Each
delegate to the National Council could represent two
organizations only, while formerly he could represent
five. The National Council was to nominate an executive
committee consisting of a secretary, assistant secretary,
treasurer, assistant treasurer, and archivist. The
work of the Confederation was to be divided among
seven committees. Dues were to be paid on a graduated
scale according to membership.</p>

<p>Besides modifying the statutes, the Congress of Tours
discussed several other questions; eight-hour day, weekly
rest, the general strike and the establishment of a trade
organ.</p>

<p>The idea of the general strike, defended by Allemanists
and anarchists, was indorsed by the Congress with a
greater majority than at previous Congresses. By this
time, however, several modifications had taken place in the
conception of the general strike. These were emphasized
by M. Guérard who defended the idea before the Congress.
Said M. Guérard:</p>

<blockquote><p>The conquest of political power is a chimera; there are at
present only three or four true socialists in the Chamber of
Deputies out of 585. Of 36,000 communes, only 150 have as
yet been conquered.</p>

<p>The partial strikes fail because the workingmen become demoralized
and succumb under the intimidation of the employers
protected by the government. The general strike will last
a short while and its repression will be impossible; as to intimidation,
it is still less to be feared. The necessity of defending
the factories, workshops, manufactures, stores, etc., will
scatter and disperse the army....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
And then, in the fear that the strikes may damage the railways,
the signals, the works of art, the government will be
obliged to protect the 39,000 kilometers of railroad lines by
drawing up the troops all along them. The 300,000 men of
the active army, charged with the surveillance of 39 million
meters, will be isolated from one another by 130 meters, and
this can be done only on the condition of abandoning the protection
of the depots, of the stations, of the factories, etc. ...
and of abandoning the employers to themselves, thus leaving
the field free in the large cities to the revolted workingmen.</p>

<p>The principal force of the general strike consists in its power
of imposing itself. A strike in one trade, in one branch of industry,
must involve other branches.</p>

<p>The general strike can not be decreed in advance; it will
burst forth suddenly: a strike of the railway men, for instance,
if declared, will be the signal of the general strike. It will be
the duty of militant workingmen, when this signal is given, to
make their comrades in the syndicats leave their work. Those
who continue to work on that day will be compelled, or forced,
to quit.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And M. Guérard, applauded by the audience, concluded:
&#8220;The general strike will be the Revolution,
peaceful or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, as a concession to the opponents of the
general strike, the Congress of Tours decided that the
&#8220;Committee for the propaganda of the general strike&#8221;
should be independent of the Confederation. It was also
from now on to collect only five per cent of all strike-subscriptions.</p>

<p>The Congress of Tours also admonished the syndicats
to abandon their political preoccupations which were
held to be the cause of disorganization.</p>

<p>These changes helped but little. During 1896-97 the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Confederation counted 11 federations, 1 federated union,
1 trade union, the Union of Syndicats of Paris, and three
national syndicats. The Federation of Bourses declined
either to join or to help the Confederation. The number
of delegates to the National Council was again insufficient
to constitute the committees. The income for
the year, including the balance from the previous year,
amounted to 1,558 francs.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The Congress of Toulouse, therefore, decided to make
new changes. Accepting the suggestion of the Federation
of Bourses whose adherence was desired, the Confederation
was to consist now of (1) the Federation of
Bourses du Travail, (2) of National federations of trade
and of industry, and (3) of local syndicats or of local
federations of trades which were not yet organized
nationally or whose national federations refused to join
the Confederation. The Confederation was to be represented
by the Federal Committee of the Federation of
Bourses and by the National Council of the Federations
of trade.</p>

<p>The Congress of Toulouse again declared that &#8220;the
general strike was synonymous with Revolution,&#8221; and
decided that sub-committees for the propaganda of the
general strike should be established in the <i>Bourses du
Travail</i> to keep in touch with the General Committee
in Paris. It discussed several other questions: trade-journal,
suppression of prison-work, eight-hour day, and
among these, for the first time, the questions of the boycott
and of <i>sabotage</i>.</p>

<p>The report on boycott and <i>sabotage</i><a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>  was prepared by
two anarchists, Pouget and Delesalle. The report explained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the origin of the boycott and of <i>sabotage</i>, and
gave instances of their application in different countries.
It referred in particular to the <i>Go Canny</i> practice of the
English workingmen whose principle the report merely
wanted to generalize and to formulate.</p>

<blockquote><p>Up to the present time [read the report] the workingmen have
declared themselves revolutionary; but most of the time they
have remained on theoretical ground: they have labored to
extend the ideas of emancipation, they have tried to sketch a
plan of a future society from which human exploitation should
be eliminated.</p>

<p>But why, beside this educational work, the necessity of which
is incontestable, has nothing been tried in order to resist the
encroachments of capitalists and to render the exigencies of
employers less painful to the workingmen?</p></blockquote>

<p>To this end the report recommended the use of the boycott
and of <i>sabotage</i>, which should take place by the side
of the strike as the workingmen's means of defense and
offense. The report shows how these methods could be
used in particular cases. <i>Sabotage</i> particularly, sometimes
applied to the quantity, sometimes to the quality,
should bring home to the employer that the workingmen
are determined to render &#8220;poor work for poor pay&#8221;.</p>

<p>The report concluded:</p>

<blockquote><p>The boycott and its indispensable complement, <i>sabotage</i>, furnishes
us with an effective means of resistance which&mdash;while
awaiting the day when the workingmen will be sufficiently
strong to emancipate themselves completely&mdash;will permit us to
stand our ground against the exploitation of which we are the
victims.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the capitalists should know it: the
workingman will respect the machine only on that day when it
shall have become for him a friend which shortens labor, instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of being, as it now is, the enemy, the robber of bread,
the killer of workingmen.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Congress adopted unanimously and with great enthusiasm
a motion inviting the workingmen to apply the
boycott and <i>sabotage</i> when strikes would not yield results.</p>

<p>During 1897-98 the Federation of Bourses and the
Confederation were to work together, but no harmony
was possible. The report presented to the Congress of
Rennes (1898) is full of complaints and of accusations
on both sides. Personal difficulties between the two
secretaries, M. Pelloutier and M. Lagailse, who was an
&#8220;Allemanist,&#8221; sprang up; besides, the National Council
and the Federal Committee were animated by a different
spirit. The Federal Committee evidently tried to dominate
the National Council. The latter was weak. It
counted only 18 organizations, and no new members
were gained during 1897-98. The National Council did
not function regularly; the explanation given was that
as no functionaries were paid, they had but little time to
devote to the business of the Confederation. The dues
paid during 1897-8 amounted to 793 francs; the whole
income was 1,702 francs. The treasurer thought that
this showed that the &#8220;General Confederation of Labor
was in a flourishing condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Committee for the propaganda of the General
Strike&#8221; admitted on the contrary that it had accomplished
little. Only twenty Bourses formed sub-committees.
The five per cent of strike subscriptions was
not paid by the syndicats. Only 835 francs came in from
this source; together with the income from other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
sources, the receipts of the Committee totaled 1,086
francs; of this it spent 822 francs.</p>

<p>During 1898 the Syndicat of Railroad Workers had a
conflict with the railroad companies and a railroad strike
was imminent. The Secretary of the General Confederation
of Labor sent out a circular to all syndical organizations
of France calling their attention to the &#8220;formidable
consequences for capitalism&#8221; which such a strike
could have, if joined by all trades. The circular formulated
eight demands, such as old-age pensions; eight-hour
day, etc., which &#8220;could be realized in a few days if
the working-class, conscious of its force, and of its
rights, was willing to act energetically.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The &#8220;Committee for the propaganda of the general
strike&#8221; also took up the question. It sent out a question
to all syndicats for a referendum vote. The question
was: &#8220;Are you for an immediate general strike in
case the railroad workingmen should declare a strike?&#8221;
The report of the Committee to the Congress of Rennes
complained that the syndicats voted for the general
strike at conventions but changed their opinions or their
disposition &#8220;when the hour for action came.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>  &#8220;It was
disastrous to make such a discovery,&#8221; read the report,</p>

<blockquote><p>when it was expected that by the strike of our comrades of
the railroads, many other trades would be compelled by the
force of events to quit work, and that this would have been
the starting-point of the general strike, and possibly of that
economic revolution which alone can solve the great problems
which confront the entire world.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
The Syndicat of the Railroad Workingmen voted for a
strike. But the government intercepted the strike order
of the National Committee of the Syndicat, and the
strike did not take place.</p>

<p>The Congress of Rennes made new changes in the statutes
of the Confederation. The Federation of Bourses
was to leave the Confederation. The latter was to be
composed only of national federations of trade and of
national syndicats and to be represented by the National
Council. The &#8220;Committee of the general strike&#8221; was
to be part of the Confederation, but was to be autonomous
and was to live on its own resources.</p>

<p>The Congress discussed a number of questions: Alcoholism,
suppression of employment bureaus, election of inspectors
of industry, etc. Most reports on the various
questions adopted by the Congress assert that the workingmen
must solicit the co-operation of their representatives
in the legislative bodies of the country in order to obtain
any reforms. But one report was presented which emphasized
the opposite idea of &#8220;direct action&#8221;.</p>

<p>This report was presented by the &#8220;Committee on the
Label, the Boycott, and <i>Sabotage</i>.&#8221; The reporter on
the boycott and <i>sabotage</i>&mdash;M. Pouget&mdash;noted the little
progress that had been accomplished in the application of
these two methods since 1897, but again affirmed their
validity and recommended them to the workingman; the
report affirmed that the menace, only, of <i>sabotage</i> is often
sufficient to produce results. &#8220;The Congress,&#8221; said the
report,</p>

<blockquote><p>cannot enter into the details of these tactics; such things depend
upon the initiative and the temperament of each and are
subordinate to the diversity of industries. We can only lay
down the theory and express the wish that the boycott and
the <i>sabotage</i> should enter into the arsenal of weapons which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the workingmen use in their struggle against capitalists on the
same plane as the strike, and that, more and more, the direction
of the social movement should be towards the direct
action of individuals and towards a greater consciousness of
their personal powers.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Congress of Paris (1900) again recorded but little
progress. In the interval since Rennes (1898-1900)
only a few new federations joined the General Confederation.
The others, whose adherence was solicited, refused
or even were not &#8220;polite enough&#8221; to make a reply.
The adhering organizations paid irregularly; the
decisions of the Congresses were not executed. The
Committees still did not function because the number of
delegates to the National Council was small. The total
income for both years amounted to 3,678 francs, of
which 1,488 were dues paid.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Committee for the propaganda of the general
strike&#8221; had collected during this period (1898-1900)
4,262 francs. Of this 3,172 francs were the five per cent
of the strike subscriptions. It may also be interesting
to note that the organizations which contributed most
to this sum were: Union of Syndicats of Seine, 901 francs;
the Union of Machinists of Seine, 727 francs; the Federation
of Moulders, 536 francs; the Federation of
Metallurgy, 457 francs. The Committee published thirteen
numbers of a journal, &#8220;The General Strike,&#8221; and
a brochure on the general strike.</p>

<p>The general strike was again the subject of a long discussion
at the Congress of Paris. But the discussion
was given a new turn. The question now was: &#8220;The
general strike, its organization, its eventuality, its consequences.&#8221;
And the ideas that prevailed revealed some
further modifications in the conception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
The question was given this turn because certain syndicats
thought that the principle of the general strike
had been sufficiently affirmed and that it was time to
treat the subject practically. As the discussion showed,
the majority of the delegates thought that the general
strike could take place at any moment and that in order
to be successful, it did not presuppose a majority of
organized workingmen, nor big sums of money. A daring
revolutionary minority conscious of its aim could
carry away with it the majority of workingmen and accomplish
the act of appropriating the means of production
for society as a whole. Some even thought that in
order that the general strike should be prompt and lead
to the aim in view it was best to have no money at all;
everyone would then take what he needed wherever he
found it, and the result would be the completest possible
emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>  As one of the delegates expressed it:
&#8220;Count exclusively upon the enthusiasm (<i>entrainement</i>)
of the working-class.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>This conception of the general strike attributed to the
syndicat a revolutionary rôle, as the syndicat was to take
possession of the means of production in the name of
society as a whole. It did not exclude however the
parallel action of political parties. The latter could profit
by the general strike and seize the political power of the
State to co-operate in the transformation of society.
But the syndicats were not to count upon this possibility;
on the contrary it was their task to make the
general strike absolutely independent of all political
parties, to perform the principal part in the economic
revolution and to leave to the new government, if one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
arose, no other function but that of sanctioning the
economic change accomplished by the syndicats.</p>

<p>This emphasis upon the revolutionary and preponderant
part to be played by the syndicats went together
with a mistrust and defiance of political parties. &#8220;All
politicians are betrayers,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>  exclaimed one delegate. &#8220;In
politics one has always to deal with intrigues,&#8221; said another,
and the same sentiment pervaded the other
speeches. Though not refusing to make use of all
methods, &#8220;for the disorganization of capitalism,&#8221; all
delegates emphasized the necessity for the workingmen
to rely mainly upon themselves and upon their syndical
organizations.</p>

<p>The majority of delegates recognized also that the
general strike must necessarily have a violent character.
Though a few still thought of the general strike as of a
&#8220;peaceful revolution,&#8221; a &#8220;strike of folded arms,&#8221; the
majority rejected this conception as childish and foresaw
the inevitable collision to which the general strike would
lead.</p>

<p>All these ideas were briefly summarized in the conclusions
of the Committee appointed by the Congress to report
on the question. This Commission recommended
leaving the &#8220;Committee for the propaganda of the general
strike&#8221; as free as possible in its action. The Congress
merely determined the syndicats which were to elect the
members of the Committee. The latter was now to obtain
regular monthly dues for the continuation of its work.</p>

<p>The revolutionary spirit which manifested itself in the
conception of the general strike expressed itself also in the
resolution of the Congress on the army. This resolution
demanded the suppression of permanent armies, and invited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the syndicats to establish relations with the workingmen
in military service, to invite them to social gatherings
and to assist them financially (to establish the so-called
<i>Sou du Soldat</i>).</p>

<p>The same spirit characterized the report of the Committee
which formulated the ideas of the Congress on the
&#8220;practical means of realizing the international harmony
of the workingmen.&#8221; &#8220;Capital,&#8221; read the report, &#8220;in its
various forms is international,&#8221; and it is necessary that
labor should also be organized internationally. The slight
differences in conditions of life varying from country to
country are not important. &#8220;The predominating fact
everywhere, in all countries, is the division of society into
two categories; the producer and the non-producer, the
wage-earner and the employer.&#8221; The report went on to
say that the idea of &#8220;fatherland&#8221; (<i>patrie</i>) is a means of
protecting the strong against the weak, &#8220;an emblem of
speculation, of exploitation,&#8221; &#8220;a synonym of property,&#8221;
&#8220;a fiction for the workingmen who possess nothing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
The practical conclusion of the Committee was to bring
together the wage-earners of all countries in an international
organization which should be represented by an
international secretariat.</p>

<p>During 1900-1 the Confederation displayed a little more
activity than before. The National Council employed a
permanent employee to attend to the business of the Confederation,
at first for two, then for four hours a day at
a remuneration of 50 and then 100 francs a month. In
December, 1900, the Confederation began also to publish
its own weekly, <i>La Voix du Peuple</i>. Since 1896 the
question of a trade-journal had been on the order of the
day. It was discussed at every Congress and various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
plans were recommended in order to obtain the financial
means for a daily. The Congress of Paris, in view of the
financial impossibility of starting a daily and recognizing
that &#8220;it was more than ever necessary to create a revolutionary
syndicalist organ,&#8221; decided to publish a weekly.
One of the Committees of the National Council was to
attend to it.</p>

<p>The <i>Voix du Peuple</i>, however, was not in a satisfactory
condition at the time of the Congress of Lyons
(1901). Pouget, the editor of the paper and the secretary
of the Committee of the <i>Voix du Peuple</i>, complained
that the <i>Voix du Peuple</i>, &#8220;suffered from the
apathy and the negligence of the comrades.&#8221; Only 260
syndicats subscribed for the paper (out of 2,700 syndicats
then in existence). In Paris only 600 copies were
sold weekly. The finances showed a deficit for the year
of over 6,000 francs. The number of copies printed fell
from 12,000-14,000 during the first months to 800 during
the later months.</p>

<p>The secretary of the Confederation, M. Guérard, also
complained that the &#8220;Confederation was anaemic for lack
of means.&#8221; The twenty organizations&mdash;federations and
syndicats&mdash;which adhered to the Confederation during
1900-1901 paid in 1,478 francs. The total income was
4,125 francs. With such limited means the Confederation
could do nothing. The Congress of Lyons (1901)&mdash;where
all these reports were read&mdash;was provided for
by a subvention from the municipality of Lyons which
appropriated 7,000 francs for the purpose.</p>

<p>The Congress of Lyons, nevertheless, showed that the
Confederation was beginning to feel a little more confidence
in its future. The Congress decided that henceforth
only syndicats adhering to the Confederation
should take part in its Congresses. Previous to that all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
syndicats were invited to send a delegate or their mandate
to the Congresses of the Confederation. The Congresses,
therefore, neither revealed the strength of the
Confederation, nor had a binding character, and were
significant merely as revealing the state of mind of a
large part of the organized workingmen of the time.
The decision of the Congress of Lyons was to do away
with this condition and to give the Congresses of the
Confederation a more coherent and binding character.</p>

<p>Another decision taken by the Congress of Lyons was
to admit local and regional federations of syndicats.
This was directed against the Federation of Bourses.
Though more friendly since 1900, the relations between
the two organizations still gave trouble. The question
of unity, however, was urged by many workingmen, and
the Congress decided to call a special Congress for 1902
to solve this problem.</p>

<p>The Congress of Lyons revealed the further progress
of revolutionary ideas among the delegates. There were
226 delegates; these represented 26 Bourses and 8 local
federations, comprising 1,035 syndicats with 245,000
members;<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>  eight regional federations composed of 264
syndicats with 36,000 members; 8 federations of trade or
industry counting 507 syndicats with 196,000 members;
492 syndicats with 60,000 workingmen were represented
directly. The exact number of syndicats and of workingmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
represented cannot be obtained from these figures,
because one syndicat could be represented several
times in a local federation, in a Bourse, and in the federation
of trade. The delegates, however, came from
different parts of the country and were numerous enough
to show that the ideas they expressed were accepted by
a considerable number of French workingmen.</p>

<p>Of the questions discussed at Lyons three had a particular
significance as showing the revolutionary tendency
which the Confederation was taking. These were
the questions of the general strike, of labor-laws, and of
the relations to the political parties.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Committee for the propaganda of the General
Strike&#8221; reported more activity for the year 1900-1 and
greater success in its work. The Committee published
a brochure on the General Strike of which 50,000 copies
were distributed. It collected over 1,500 francs in
monthly dues, and its total income amounted to 2,447
francs. It was in touch with a number of sub-committees
in the different <i>Bourses du Travail</i>, arranged a
number of meetings on various occasions, and lent its
support to some strikes. The Committee affirmed that
the idea of the general strike had spread widely during
the year and attributed this fact to the big strikes which
had taken place in France after the International Exhibition
of 1900 and which had thrown the workingmen
into a state of agitation.</p>

<p>At the time the Congress of Lyons was being held,
the miners were threatening to strike, if their demands
were not granted by the companies. The delegate of
the miners was at the Congress, and the discussion that
took place under these conditions was very characteristic.</p>

<p>The Committee on the general strike which consisted
of fifteen members reported:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
The idea of the general strike is sufficiently understood to-day.
In repeatedly putting off the date of its coming, we risk discrediting
it forever by enervating the revolutionary energies.</p>

<p>What better occasion to realize it!</p>

<p>The miners will give the signal on the first of November;
the working-class&mdash;in case of a revolution&mdash;counts upon this
movement which must bring them their economic liberation.</p></blockquote>

<p>And the report of the Committee went on to point
out the conditions which in its opinion indicated &#8220;that
the moment had come to try the general strike (<i>faire la
Grève générale</i>) with strong chances of success.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The delegate from the miners said: &#8220;If you wish to
join us, we will be able not only to strike, but to bring
about the revolution; if we were made sure of the co-operation
of all trades, even if it were necessary to wait
for it two, three, or even six months, we are ready to
grant you this concession.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The following motion was then adopted:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Congress declares that the General Strike cannot be the
means merely of obtaining amelioration for any category of
workingmen.</p>

<p>Its aim can be only the complete emancipation of the proletariat
through the violent expropriation of the capitalist class.</p>

<p>The Congress, in view of the situation, declares that the
movement which may take place in favor of the miners, the
importance or character of which nobody can foresee and
which may go to the point of a general emancipation, will be
in any case a movement of solidarity which will not impair in
the least the revolutionary principle of the general strike of
all workingmen.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The delegate of the Typographical Union (<i>La Fédération
du Livre</i>) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
combated the idea of the general strike
and argued that it was impossible in view of the small
number of organized workingmen. But his argument
had no effect on the Congress. It was rejected as of no
importance because the minority of organized workingmen
could carry away with it the majority.</p>

<p>The question of labor laws was the subject of an animated
discussion at the Congress because of its importance.
The answer given to this question was to
determine the attitude of the General Confederation to
legislative reforms and to the State in general.</p>

<p>The question was a very practical one. The government
of Waldeck-Rousseau (22 June, 1899-6 June,
1902), in which the socialist, Millerand, was Minister of
Commerce and Industry, outlined a number of labor
laws which touched upon the most vital questions of the
labor movement. The most important of these law-projects
were on strikes and arbitration, on the composition
of the superior Council of Labor, on the institution
of Councils of Labor, and on the modification of
the law of 1884.</p>

<p>The policy of the government in planning these laws
was clear and expressly stated. It was the continuation
and accentuation of the policy which had guided M.
Waldeck-Rousseau in 1884 when he was Minister of the
Interior in the Cabinet of Jules Ferry, and which had
then found partial expression in the ministerial circular
on the application of the new law on syndicats.</p>

<p>This &#8220;Circular,&#8221; sent out to the Prefects August 25,
1884, pointed out to the Prefects that it was the duty of
the State not merely to watch over the strict observation
of the law, but &#8220;to favor the spirit of association&#8221;
among the workingmen and &#8220;to stimulate&#8221; the latter to
make use of the new right. In the conception of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
government the syndicats were to be &#8220;less a weapon of
struggle&#8221; than &#8220;an instrument of material, moral and
intellectual progress.&#8221; It was &#8220;the wish of the Government
and of the Chambers to see the propagation, in the
largest possible measure, of the trade associations and of
the institutions which they were destined to engender&#8221;
(such as old-age pension funds, mutual credit banks,
libraries, co-operative societies, etc.) and the government
expected the Prefects &#8220;to lend active assistance&#8221;
in the organization of syndicats and in the creation of
syndical institutions.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The aim of Waldeck-Rousseau was to bring about the
&#8220;alliance of the bourgeoisie and of the working-class&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
which Gambetta and other republican statesmen had untiringly
preached as the only condition of maintaining
the Republic. In the period 1899-1902 this policy
seemed still more indispensable. It was the time when
the agitation caused by the Dreyfus affair assumed the
character of a struggle between the republican and anti-republican
forces of France. Republicans, Radicals,
Socialists, and Anarchists were fighting hand in hand
against Monarchists, Nationalists, Anti-Semites and
Clericals. The cabinet of Waldeck-Rousseau constituted
itself a &#8220;Cabinet of Republican Defense&#8221; and it sought
to attain its end by securing the support of all republican
elements of the country. This was the cause which
prompted Waldeck-Rousseau to invite a socialist, Millerand,
to enter his cabinet and to accentuate his policy
of attaching the working-class to the Republic by a
series of protective labor laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The policy of the Government was clearly expressed
by Millerand in the Chamber of Deputies on November
23, 1899. &#8220;It has appeared to me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that the
best means for bringing back the working masses to the
Republic, is to show them not by words, but by facts,
that the republican government is above everything else
the government of the small and of the weak.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The facts by which M. Millerand undertook to show
this were a number of decrees by which the government
tried to enforce a stricter observation of labor-laws
already in existence and a series of new law-projects for
the future protection of labor, such as the bill on a ten-hour
day, which became law on March 30, 1900. As
M. Millerand expressed it, this law was &#8220;a measure of
moralization, of solidarity, and of social pacification.&#8221;</p>

<p>Social pacification was the supreme aim of M. Millerand
and of the government. M. Millerand hoped to
attain this by calling workingmen to participation in the
legislative activities of the Republic, by accustoming
them to peaceable discussions with employers, and by
regulating the more violent forms of the economic
struggle.</p>

<p>A decree from September 1, 1899, modified the constitution
of the Superior Council of Labor, in existence
since 1891, so that it should henceforth consist of 22
elected workingmen, 22 elected employers and 22 members
appointed by the Minister from among the deputies
of the Chamber, the senators and other persons representing
&#8220;general interests.&#8221; The Superior Council of
Labor was &#8220;an instrument of study, of information and
of consultation&#8221; in matters of labor legislation. It
studied law-projects affecting the conditions of labor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
made its own suggestions to the government, but had
no legislative powers.</p>

<p>The decree of M. Millerand was particularly significant
in one respect: it called upon the workingmen organized
in the syndicats to elect fifteen members of the Superior
Council of Labor. M. Millerand pointed out the significance
of this measure in a speech delivered on June
5, 1900. Said he:</p>

<blockquote><p>The workingmen are henceforth warned, that in order to
participate through delegates sprung from their own ranks
in the elaboration of economic reforms which concern
them most, it is necessary and sufficient that they enter
the ranks of that great army of which the syndicats are the
battalions. How can they refuse to do this? By inducing
them to do so we believe that we are defending their legitimate
interests at the same time that we are serving the cause of
social peace in this country.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The &#8220;Councils of Labor&#8221; were organized by two decrees
from September 17, 1900, and from January 2,
1901. Composed of an equal number of workingmen
and of employers, these Councils had for their principal
mission to enlighten the government, as well as workingmen
and employers, on the actual and necessary conditions
of labor, to facilitate thereby industrial harmony
and general agreement between the interested parties,
to furnish in cases of collective conflicts competent
mediators, and to inform the public authorities on the
effects produced by labor legislation.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>M. Millerand emphasized that the Councils of Labor
were to bring workingmen and employers together for
the discussion of &#8220;their general interests&#8221; and that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
new institution would be one more motive for the utilization
of the law of 1884 on syndicats. &#8220;To encourage
by all means the formation of these trade-associations,
so useful for the progress of social peace,&#8221; wrote the
Minister in his decree, &#8220;is a task which a republican
government cannot neglect.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>To enlarge the possible operations of the syndicats,
the government also introduced a bill into the Chamber
(November 14, 1899) which contained several modifications
of the law of 1884. This bill proposed to extend
the commercial capacities of the syndicat and to grant
the syndicat the rights of a juridical person.</p>

<p>To complete the series of measures which were to impart
a peaceful character to the syndical movement, M.
Millerand introduced into the chamber a bill (November
15, 1900) on the regulation of strikes and on arbitration.
This law-project proposed a complicated mechanism for
the settlement of economic conflicts. It hinged on the
principle that strikes should be decided by secret ballot
and by a majority vote renewed at brief intervals by all
workingmen concerned; permanent arbitration boards
in the industrial establishments were part of the mechanism.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Toward this series of labor laws the Congress of
Lyons was to define its attitude. The principle of the
Superior Council of Labor was accepted by a majority of
258 against 205 votes (5 blank); the project on the
regulation of strikes and on arbitration was rejected by
a unanimous vote minus five; the Councils of Labor
proposition was rejected by a majority of 279 against
175 (18 blank).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
The discussion on the labor laws brought out the fact
that the idea of &#8220;direct action&#8221; had undergone further
modifications as a result of the policy of the government.
M. Waldeck-Rousseau was denounced by the speakers as
&#8220;a clever defender of the interests of the bourgeoisie&#8221;
who wished merely to stop the offensive movement of the
workingmen.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>  The legislative measures of the &#8220;pseudo-socialist
minister&#8221;,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>  Millerand, were interpreted as schemes
for restraining the revolutionary action of the syndicats.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
The workingmen were warned that, if they accepted the
laws, they would &#8220;reinforce a power which they wanted to
destroy&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>  They were reminded that the main function of
the syndicat was to organize the workmen for their final
emancipation which presupposes the &#8220;abolition of the
wage-system&#8221; and that all &#8220;so-called labor laws&#8221; would
only retard the hour of final liberation.</p>

<p>The revolutionary elements of the Congress did not
deny, however, the possibility or the desirability of reforms.
They insisted only upon particular methods of obtaining
reforms and upon a particular kind of reforms. They rejected
all peaceful discussion with employers because the interests
of employers and of workingmen were held to be distinct
and antagonistic. They did not want an &#8220;economic
parliamentarism&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>  which would necessarily take the sting
out of the workingmen's weapons and deprive the syndicats
of their force. They wanted such reforms only as should
&#8220;undermine the foundations&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>  of existing society and
which should advance the movement for &#8220;integral emancipation&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
by strengthening the forces and the organization
of the workingmen.</p>

<p>Such reforms could be obtained only &#8220;independently of
all parliamentarism&#8221;,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>  by the workingmen organized in
their syndicats displaying all their initiative, manifesting
all their energies, relying only upon themselves and
not upon intermediaries. Only in this way would the syndicats
wrest &#8220;piece by piece from capitalistic society reforms
the application of which would finally give the exploited
class the force which is indispensable in order to
bring about the social revolution&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>These ideas showed the further application which the
principle of &#8220;direct action&#8221; was given by the revolutionary
elements in the syndicats. The syndicats were not
only to carry on their struggle &#8220;directly&#8221; against employers
by strikes, boycotts and <i>sabotage</i>, but also against the
State, and not only against the State appearing as the
&#8220;enemy of labor&#8221;, but also against the State wishing to
become the protector and benefactor of the workingmen.
This hostility to the State and to its reform-legislation
marked a further accentuation of the ideas of revolutionary
syndicalism.</p>

<p>The Congress of Lyons took, also, a decided stand on
the relations of the syndicats to political action. Under
&#8220;political action&#8221; of course the action of the Socialist
parties was meant. After the foundation of the General
Confederation of Labor certain important changes had
taken place in the socialist movement of France which
could not but have their effect upon the syndicats.</p>

<p>In 1893 the socialist parties had their first big success
in the general elections. They obtained about 600,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
votes<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>  and elected over 50 deputies. The socialist deputies
in the Chamber constituted a Parliamentary Group&mdash;<i>Union
Socialiste</i>&mdash;which acted in common. This
strengthened the tendency toward union which had
already manifested itself, during the elections, when the
Socialists had entered into unions among themselves.</p>

<p>The unity in action was further made possible by a
unity in views which was becoming more and more manifest.
After 1892, when the Guesdists obtained a large
number of votes in the municipal elections and gained a
number of municipalities, their ideas on some of the
most important points of their program began to
change. In 1894, at their Congress of Nantes, the
Guesdists elaborated a detailed program of reforms designed
to win the votes of the agricultural population.
This program made no mention of the collective appropriation
of the soil; on the contrary, it stated that, &#8220;in
the agricultural domain, the means of production, which
is the soil, is in many places still in the possession of the
producers themselves as individual property&#8221; and that
&#8220;if this state of conditions, characterized by peasant
proprietorship, must inevitably disappear, socialism must
not precipitate its disappearance.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>  With similar promises
of reform the Guesdists addressed other classes of
the population: artisans, small merchants and the lower
strata of the middle classes.</p>

<p>Formerly ardent revolutionists, they now began to
emphasize the legal aspect of their activity and the
emancipating influence of universal suffrage. Jules
Guesde himself in his speeches in the Chamber of Deputies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
on various occasions expressed his belief that universal
suffrage was the instrument with which all questions
might be peacefully solved,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>  and that nothing but
legal weapons would throw the Republic into the hands
of the socialist army. G. Deville, then one of the principal
theorists of the party, affirmed in 1896 that the
only actual task of the party was to increase the number
of socialist electors and representatives.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>  With the
affirmation of the emancipating significance of universal
suffrage the importance of parliamentary action was
more and more emphasized.</p>

<p>Thus the &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; socialists were approaching
the reformist elements composed of Broussists and
of Independents. In 1896 this <i>rapprochement</i> was manifested
at the banquet of Saint Mandé arranged on the
occasion of the success obtained by the socialists during
the municipal elections of that year. All socialist parties
took part in it and Millerand delivered a speech in
which he outlined the common points of the socialist
program. This program emphasized the peaceful and
evolutionary character of socialism: &#8220;We address ourselves
only to universal suffrage,&#8221; said Millerand, ...
&#8220;In order to begin the socialization of the means of
production, it is necessary and sufficient for the Socialist
party to pursue with the help of universal suffrage the
conquest of the political powers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>  Guesde, present at
the banquet, approved and &#8220;applauded&#8221; the definition
of Socialism given by Millerand.</p>

<p>The Dreyfus affair brought the socialists for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
time into still closer contact. A &#8220;Committee of Harmony&#8221;
(<i>Comité d'Entente</i>) was formed in which all the
socialist organizations were represented. The demand
for unity was expressed in the socialist periodical press,
and J. Jaurès outlined a plan according to which the old
separate and rival factions were to disappear in one unified
party.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>  The belief in the possibility of such a unified
party was general.</p>

<p>The entrance of Millerand into the Ministry of Waldeck-Rousseau
was a sudden shock which again disrupted
the elements tending toward union. The Guesdists,
Blanquists and a few other groups denounced the
act of Millerand as a violation of the principles of class
and class-struggle&mdash;the fundamental principles of Socialism.
The Independents, Broussists and similar elements,
on the contrary, insisted upon the necessity of taking
part in the general life of the country and of assuming
responsibilities when they are inevitable. At two general
Congresses of all socialist organizations held in
Paris (December, 1899, and September, 1900) this question
was discussed. The Congresses ended with a quarrel
among the various socialist organizations which led
to complete rupture at the following Congress in Lyons
in May, 1901. The Guesdists, Blanquists and several
regional federations formed the <i>Parti Socialiste de
France</i>; the Independents, Broussists, and Allemanists
formed the <i>Parti Socialiste Français</i>, which supported
Millerand and the cabinet of Waldeck-Rousseau. Within
each new grouping, however, the old organizations remained
intact.</p>

<p>The &#8220;case Millerand&#8221; raised such violent polemics,
such bitter mutual accusations among the Socialists that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
many members of the party felt disgusted. Even the
French socialist movement, so rich in inner divisions
and dissensions, had never before experienced such a
critical condition.</p>

<p>In view of this situation the organized workingmen
were anxious now more than ever to keep politics out of
the syndicats. The resolution adopted unanimously by
the Congress of Lyons insisted upon the fact that the
introduction of politics into the syndicats would cause
division in the syndicalist ranks, and therefore invited
the syndicats and the federations to remain independent
of all political parties, &#8220;leaving to individuals the undeniable
right to devote themselves to that kind of struggle
which they prefer in the political field.&#8221; The syndicat
as an organization, however, should remain neutral;
otherwise it would be &#8220;false to its true rôle which consists
in grouping all the exploited without distinction of
race, nationality, philosophical or religious opinions, and
political views.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The reaction of socialist workingmen, however, to the
situation created by the &#8220;case Millerand&#8221; was of a more
complicated character. While the entrance of a socialist
minister into the government aroused hopes and expectations
in the minds of many, to others it seemed the
beginning of the end of socialism. Habitually regarding
socialism as a class-movement, imbued with the ideas of
class and class-struggle, they were shocked and grieved
at the &#8220;collaboration of classes&#8221; which Millerand practised
in the government and the Socialists in Parliament.</p>

<p>To these socialist workingmen the danger seemed the
greater because it presented itself as a crowning act of a
policy that had been pursued for some time by all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
socialists. As we have seen, even the revolutionary
Guesdists had become more and more moderate. They
had co-operated in Parliament with the republican parties
and had concluded alliances during elections with &#8220;bourgeois&#8221;
parties. At the general Congress of socialists in
Paris in 1899, M. Briand in a clever and somewhat biting
speech pointed out to the revolutionary socialists that
their policy had made the &#8220;case Millerand&#8221; possible.
&#8220;It seems,&#8221; said Briand, &#8220;that great astonishment has
been aroused in our comrades of the <i>Parti Ouvrier</i>
(Guesdists) by the entrance of our comrade Millerand
into a bourgeois government. But, citizens of the <i>Parti
Ouvrier</i>, what has taken place is the very consequence
of the policy which by successive concessions you have
forced upon the entire socialist party.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>  And Briand
pointed out these &#8220;successive concessions&#8221; which deprived
the Guesdists of their revolutionary character.
To quote M. Briand again:</p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, you become interested in these [electoral] struggles which
gave immediate results, and little by little our militant comrades
also became interested in them, took a liking for them
to such a degree that they soon came to believe that in order
to triumph definitely over the capitalist society nothing was
necessary but to storm the ballot-boxes. Thus within recent
years the country could gain the impression that the socialist
party was no longer a revolutionary party.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This impression many socialist workingmen had, and
the &#8220;case Millerand&#8221; strengthened it in them. But
preservation of the revolutionary character of socialism
was for them a necessity, equivalent to maintaining their
belief in the coming of socialism at all. These workingmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of all socialist parties, Allemanists, Blanquists, and
even Guesdists, therefore, now threw themselves with
greater energy into the syndicalist movement which
seemed to them the only refuge for the revolutionary
spirit. There they met the Communist-Anarchists who
had been taking an active part in the syndicalist movement
for some time. The Communist-Anarchists before
1895 had generally shown little sympathy for the syndicats
where the workingmen, they said, were either engaged
in politics or trying to obtain paltry reforms.
But tired of carrying on a merely verbal propaganda and
spurred on by Pelloutier,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>  they began to change their
attitude after 1895, and after 1899 became influential in
many syndicalist organizations. Their criticism of electoral
action, their denunciation of political intriguing,
now under the conditions created by the &#8220;case Millerand,&#8221;
fell on prepared ground and yielded fruit. A
decided anti-political tendency gained strength in the
syndicats.</p>

<p>This tendency was further strengthened by the economic
events of the period. During these years, particularly after
the Exhibition of Paris, a series of big strikes took place
in various parts of France, among the miners in the north,
the dockers in the ports of the south, in the Creusot works,
etc. These strikes were partly the result of the large expectations
aroused in the workingmen by the entrance of a
socialist minister into the government. But the government
sent troops against some of the strikers and in two
or three cases blood was shed. The agitation aroused by
the bloodshed was great and intensified the defiance toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Millerand and toward the political parties in general.
On the other hand, some of the strikes became more or
less general in character and were won by the energetic
action of the strikers. This strengthened the conviction
in the efficacy of economic action and in the possibility of
the general strike.</p>

<p>Under the combined influence of all these conditions, the
socialist and anarchist workingmen, during this period,
began to ascribe to the syndicats a decided preponderance
in all respects, and they actively engaged in making their
revolutionary ideas predominant in the syndical organizations.
The resolutions and discussions at the Congress
of Lyons revealed this state of mind and the progress attained.
The revolutionary elements of the syndicats had
by this time become conscious of themselves, and in opposition
to the program of the political socialists, they
advanced the idea of the General Confederation of Labor
as a distinctly unifying conception which in the future
was to play a great social rôle. &#8220;The General Confederation
of Labor uniting all the workingmen's syndical
forces,&#8221; said the Secretary, Guérard, in his report to the
Congress of Lyons, &#8220;is destined to become the revolutionary
instrument capable of transforming society.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
In greeting the delegates at the opening of the Congress,
Bourchet addressed them as &#8220;the representatives of the
great party of Labor&#8221; (<i>grand parti du travail</i>).<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>  The
same term was used by other delegates,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>  and in the summing-up
of the work of the Congress, the emphasis was
laid upon the demarcation between the syndicalists and
the politicians which the Congress had clearly shown.</p>

<p>Thus, with the Congress of Lyons the General Confederation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of Labor may be said to have entered definitely
upon the revolutionary path. The main ideas of
revolutionary syndicalism were clearly formulated and
consciously accepted. The main functionaries elected
after the Congress were revolutionists, viz., the secretary
Griffuelhes and the assistant secretary and editor of the
<i>Voix du Peuple</i> Pouget.</p>

<p>The Congress of Montpellier held next year (1902)
showed constant accentuation of the revolutionary tendencies.
The Congress of Montpellier was almost entirely
occupied with the elaboration of a new constitution
which would unite the General Confederation and the
Federation of Bourses. Statutes acceptable to both
organizations were adopted to go into force on January
1, 1903.</p>

<p>At the Congress of Montpellier the report of the Secretary
Griffuelhes claimed that during the year the Confederation
had made progress. But this progress was
very slight. The real growth of the Confederation began
after its fusion with the Federation of Bourses.
Since then also dates the more active participation of
the Confederation in the political and social life of the
country. But before taking up the history of the General
Confederation since 1902, it seems advisable to sum
up the main ideas of revolutionary syndicalism in a more
systematic way.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Doctrine of Revolutionary Syndicalism</span></h2>

<p>When the General Confederation of Labor adopted its
new constitution in 1902, the main ideas of revolutionary
syndicalism had already been clearly formulated.
Since then, however, a considerable amount of literature
has appeared on the subject, either clarifying or further
developing various points of the doctrine. This literature
consists mainly of numerous articles in the periodical
press and of pamphlets and is, accordingly, of an
unsystematic character. The attempt is made in this
chapter to sum up in a systematic way the leading ideas
of revolutionary syndicalism common to all who call
themselves revolutionary syndicalists. Consideration of
individual ideas and of contributions of particular writers
will be left to a following chapter.</p>

<p>The fundamental idea of revolutionary syndicalism is
the idea of class-struggle. Society is divided into two
classes, the class of employers who possess the instruments
of production and the class of workingmen who
own nothing but their labor-power and who live by selling
it.</p>

<p>Between the two classes an incessant struggle is going
on. This struggle is a fact, not a theory in need of
proof. It is a fact manifested every day in the relations
between employers and wage-earners, a fact inherent in
the economic organization of existing society.</p>

<p>The class-struggle is not a fact to be deplored; on the
contrary, it should be hailed as the creative force in society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
as the force which is working for the emancipation
of the working-class. It is the class-struggle which is
consolidating the workingmen into a compact unity opposed
to the exploitation and domination of employers.
It is the class-struggle which is evolving new ideas of
right (<i>droit</i>) in opposition to the existing law. It is
the class-struggle which is developing the self-consciousness,
the will-power and the moral character of the
workingmen and is creating forms of organization proper
to them. In a word, it is the class-struggle which is
forging the material and moral means of emancipation
for the workingmen and putting these weapons into
their hands.</p>

<p>The task of the syndicalists is to organize the more or
less vague class-feeling of the workingmen and to raise
it to the clear consciousness of class-interests and of
class-ideals. This aim can be attained only by organizing
the workingmen into syndicats. The syndicat is an
association of workingmen of the same or of similar
trades, and is held together by bonds of common interest.
In this is its strength. Of all human groupings it
is the most fundamental and the most permanent, because
men in society are interested above everything else
in the satisfaction of their economic needs.</p>

<p>The strength, permanence, and class-character of economic
groups are made conspicuous by comparison with
forms of grouping based on other principles. Political
parties, groups of idealists, or communities professing a
common creed, are associations which cannot but be
weak and transient in view of their heterogeneous composition
and of the accidental character of their bond of
union. Political bodies, for instance, are made up of
men of various interests grouped only by community of
ideas. This is true even of the Socialist party which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
consists of manufacturers, financiers, doctors, and lawyers,
as well as of workingmen. Even the Socialist
party cannot, therefore, make prominent the class-division
of society, and tends to merge all classes into
one conglomeration which is unstable and incapable of
persistent collective action. Only in groupings of real
and fundamental interests such as the syndicats, are men
of the same conditions brought together for purposes
inextricably bound up with life.</p>

<p>The syndicat groups men of one and the same trade
in their capacity of workingmen only, regardless of any
other qualifications. The workingmen entering a syndicat
may be Catholics or Protestants, Republicans,
Socialists, or Monarchists, they may be of any color,
race or nationality; in their capacity of workingmen
they are all equally welcome and legitimate members of
the syndicat. A workingman enrolling in a syndicat is
not entering a party, not subscribing to a platform, nor
accepting a creed. He is simply entering into a relation
which is forced upon him by his very position in society,
and is grouping himself with his fellowmen in such a
way as to derive more strength for himself in the struggle
for existence, contributing at the same time to the
strength of his fellowmen.</p>

<p>These conditions make the syndicat peculiarly fit to
serve the interests of the workingmen. The syndicat is
a sphere of influence which by the volume of its suggestion
and by the constancy and intensity of its action
shapes the feelings and ideas of the workingmen after a
certain pattern. In the syndicat the workingmen forget
the things which divide them and are intent upon that
which unites them. In the syndicat the workingmen
meet to consider common interests, to discuss their
identical situation, to plan together for defense and aggression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and in all ways are made to feel their group-solidarity
and their antagonism to the class of employers.</p>

<p>In view of this the syndicats should prefer industrial
unionism to craft unionism. The separation of workingmen
into trades is apt to develop in them a corporate
spirit which is not in harmony with the class-idea. The
industrial union, on the contrary, widens the mental
horizon of the workingman and his range of solidarity
with his fellow workers and thus serves better to
strengthen his class-consciousness.</p>

<p>The syndicat is the instrument with which the workingmen
can enter into a &#8220;direct&#8221; struggle with employers.
&#8220;Direct action&#8221; is what the syndicalists most insist
upon, as the only means of educating the workingmen
and of preparing them for the final act of emancipation.
&#8220;Direct action&#8221; is action by the workingmen themselves
without the help of intermediaries; it is not necessarily
violent action, though it may assume violent forms; it
is the manifestation of the consciousness and of the will
of the workingmen themselves, without the intervention
of an external agent: it consists in pressure exerted directly
by those interested for the sake of obtaining the
ends in view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Direct action&#8221; may assume various forms, but the
principal ones in the struggle against employers are: the
strike, the boycott, the label, and <i>sabotage</i>.</p>

<p>The strike, in the view of the syndicalists, is the manifestation
of the class-struggle <i>par excellence</i>. The strike
brings the workingmen face to face with the employers
in a clash of interests. A strike clears up, as if by a flash
of lightning, the deep antagonism which exists between
those who employ and those who work for employers.
It further deepens the chasm between them, consolidating
the employers on the one hand, and the workingmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
on the other, over against one another. It is a revolutionary
fact of great value.</p>

<p>All strikes, partial, general in a locality, or general in
some one trade, have this revolutionary influence, particularly
when they are conducted in a certain way. If
the workingmen rely only on their treasury, the strike
degenerates into a mere contest between two money
bags&mdash;that of the employer and that of the syndicat&mdash;and
loses much of its value. Still more are the syndicalists
opposed to methods of conciliation and arbitration.
The idea of the revolutionary syndicalists is
that a strike should be won by <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, by
quick and energetic pressure on employers. The financial
strength of workingmen when striking should not
be considered. Money may be supplied by contributions
of workingmen of other trades and localities, in itself
another means of developing the solidarity of the working-class.
Sometimes a strike may be won by calling
out sympathetic strikes in other trades.</p>

<p>Strikes conducted in this manner yield practical results
and serve also as means of educating the workingmen.
They reveal to the workingmen their power, as
producers, and their importance in the productive system
of society. The label, on the other hand, is a means
of bringing home to the workingmen their importance
as consumers, and of making them wield this power for
their own benefit.</p>

<p>The boycott reveals the power of the workingmen,
either as producers or as consumers. It may be wielded
against an employer whose shop is avoided, or against a
firm in its capacity as seller. It is an effective means of
forcing employers to terms.</p>

<p><i>Sabotage</i> consists in obstructing in all possible ways
the regular process of production to the dismay and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
disadvantage of the employer. The manifestations of
<i>sabotage</i> are many, varying with the nature of the
industry and with the ingenuity of the workers. In
its primitive form, <i>sabotage</i> is a tacit refusal on the part
of the workers to exert properly their energy or skill in
the performance of their work, in retaliation for any injustice
which, in their opinion, had been inflicted upon them
by their employers. This form of <i>sabotage</i> includes such
practices as those summarized in the Scotch <i>Ca Canny</i>
(slow work for low wages) and in the French principle
of a <i>mauvaise paye mauvais travail</i> (bad work for bad
pay). It also includes the recent practices of the railroad
workers in Austria, Italy, and France who disorganized
the railway service of their respective countries by
obeying literally all the rules and regulations of the service
code and by refusing to apply discretion and common
sense in the performance of their duties. The distinguishing
characteristic of this form of <i>sabotage</i> is that in
applying it the workers remain within the limits of their
contract and avoid any manifest violation of the law,
though the loss inflicted upon the employer may be very
heavy.</p>

<p>A more aggressive form of <i>sabotage</i> is that which expresses
itself in deliberate damage done either to the
product of labor or to the nature of the service. An instance
of the latter was the so-called <i>grève perlée</i> applied
by the French railway men, which consisted in
wilful misdirection of baggage and of perishable merchandise.
This form of <i>sabotage</i> implies disregard for the
laws of property and for the clauses of the labor contract,
but it is carried on in a manner which makes detection
of motive very difficult.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
From this form of <i>sabotage</i> it is but a short step to
the most aggressive and violent kind which finds expression
in the deliberate and open disorganization of machinery.
This form of <i>sabotage</i> has nothing in common
with the destruction of machinery practiced by unorganized
workers during the early stages of the capitalist
régime. It aims not at the destruction of the machine
as a means of production, but at the temporary disability
of the machine during strikes for the purpose of
preventing employers to carry on production with the
help of strikebreakers. Even in this most aggressive
form, <i>sabotage</i> may involve very little violence. The
syndicalists strongly condemn any act of <i>sabotage</i> which
may result in the loss of life.</p>

<p>Such are the &#8220;direct&#8221; methods of struggle against
employers. But the revolutionary syndicalists have
another enemy, the State, and the struggle against the
latter is another aspect of &#8220;direct action.&#8221;</p>

<p>The State appears to the syndicalists as the political
organization of the capitalist class. Whether monarchist,
constitutional, or republican, it is one in character, an
organization whose function it is to uphold and to protect
the privileges of the property-owners against the
demands of the working-class. The workingmen are,
therefore, necessarily forced to hurl themselves against
the State in their efforts toward emancipation, and they
cannot succeed until they have broken the power of the
State.</p>

<p>The struggle against the State, like the struggle
against the employers, must be carried on directly by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the workingmen themselves. This excludes the participation
of the syndicats in politics and in electoral campaigning.
The parliamentary system is a system of
representation opposed in principle to &#8220;direct action,&#8221;
and serves the interests of the bourgeoisie, for the management
of which it is particularly suited. The workingmen
can derive no benefit from it. The parliamentary
system breeds petty, self-seeking politicians,
corrupts the better elements that enter into it and is a
source of intrigues and of &#8220;wire-pulling.&#8221; The so-called
representatives of the workingman do not and cannot
avoid the contagious influence of parliament. Their
policy degenerates into bargaining, compromising and
collaboration with the bourgeois political parties and
weakens the class-struggle.</p>

<p>The syndicats, therefore, if not hostile, must remain at
least indifferent to parliamentary methods and independent
of political parties. They must, however, untiringly
pursue their direct struggle against the State.
The direct method of forcing the State to yield to the
demands of the workingmen consists in exerting external
pressure on the public authorities. Agitation in
the press, public meetings, manifestations, demonstrations
and the like, are the only effective means of making
the government reckon with the will of the working-class.</p>

<p>By direct pressure on the government the workingmen
may obtain reforms of immediate value to themselves.
Only such reforms, gained and upheld by force,
are real. All other reforms are but a dead letter and a
means of deceiving the workingmen.</p>

<p>The democratic State talks much about social reforms,
labor legislation and the like. In fact, however, all
labor laws that are of real importance have been passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
only under the pressure of the workingmen. Those
which owe their existence to democratic legislators alone
are devised to weaken the revolutionary strength of the
working-class. Among such laws are those on conciliation
and arbitration. All democratic governments are
anxious to have Boards of Conciliation and of Arbitration,
in order to check strikes which are the main force
of the working-class. Workingmen must be opposed to
these reforms, which are intended to further the harmony
and collaboration of classes, because the ideology
of class-harmony is one of the most dangerous snares
which are set for the workingmen in a democratic State.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
This ideology blinds the workingmen to the real facts of
inequality and of class-distinctions which are the very
foundations of existing society. It allures them into
hopes which cannot be fulfilled and leads them astray
from the only path of emancipation which is the struggle
of classes.</p>

<p>Another idea which is used by the democratic State for
the same purpose is the idea of patriotism. &#8220;Our country&#8221;,
&#8220;our nation&#8221;, are mottoes inculcated into the mind
of the workingman from his very childhood. But these
words have no meaning for the workingman. The workingman's
country is where he finds work. In search of
work he leaves his native land and wanders from place to
place. He has no fatherland (<i>patrie</i>) in any real meaning
of the term. Ties of tradition, of a common intellectual
and moral heritage do not exist for him. In his experience
as workingman he finds that there is but one real
tie, the tie of economic interest which binds him to all
the workingmen of the world, and separates him at the
same time from all the capitalists of the world. The international
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
solidarity of the workingmen and their anti-patriotism
are necessary consequences of the class struggle.</p>

<p>The democratic State, like any other State, does not
rely upon ideological methods alone in keeping down the
workingmen. It has recourse to brute force as well.
The judiciary, the administrative machinery and especially
the army are used as means of defeating the movements of
the working-class. The army is particularly effective as a
means of breaking strikes, of crushing the spirit of independence
in the workingmen, and as a means of keeping
up the spirit of militarism. An anti-militaristic propaganda
is, therefore, one of the most important forms of
struggle against the State, as well as against capitalism.</p>

<p>Anti-militarism consists in carrying on in the army a
propaganda of syndicalist ideas. The soldiers are reminded
that they are workingmen in uniforms, who will
one day return to their homes and shops, and who should
not, therefore, forget the solidarity which binds them to
their fellow workingmen in blouses. The soldiers are
called upon not to use their arms in strikes, and in case
of a declaration of war to refuse to take up arms. The
syndicalists threaten in case of war to declare a general
strike. They are ardent apostles of international peace
which is indispensable, in their opinion, to the success of
their movement.</p>

<p>By &#8220;direct action&#8221; against employers and the State
the workingmen may wrest from the ruling classes reforms
which may improve their condition more or less.
Such reforms can not pacify the working-class because
they do not alter the fundamental conditions of the wage
system, but they are conducive to the fortification of
the working-class and to its preparation for the final
struggle. Every successful strike, every effective boycott,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
every manifestation of the workingmen's will and
power is a blow directed against the existing order;
every gain in wages, every shortening of hours of work,
every improvement in the general conditions of employment
is one more position of importance occupied on the
march to the decisive battle, the general strike, which
will be the final act of emancipation.</p>

<p>The general strike&mdash;the supreme act of the class-war&mdash;will
abolish the classes and will establish new forms of
society. The general strike must not be regarded as a
<i>deus ex machina</i> which will suddenly appear to solve all
difficulties, but as the logical outcome of the syndicalist
movement, as the act that is being gradually prepared
by the events of every day. However remote it may
appear, it is not a Utopia and its possibility cannot be
refuted on the ground that general strikes have failed in
the past and may continue to fail in the future. The
failures of to-day are building the success of to-morrow,
and in time the hour of the successful general strike will
come.</p>

<p>What are the forms of the social organization which
will take the place of those now in existence? The
Congress of Lyons (1901) had expressed the wish to have
this question on the program of the next Congress. In
order that the answer to this question should reflect the
ideas prevalent among the workingmen, the Confederal
Committee submitted the question to the syndicats for
study. A questionnaire was sent out containing the following
questions:</p>

<p>(1) How would your syndicat act in order to transform
itself from a group for combat into a group for
production?</p>

<p>(2) How would you act in order to take possession of
the machinery pertaining to your industry?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) How do you conceive the functions of the organized
shops and factories in the future?</p>

<p>(4) If your syndicat is a group within the system of
highways, of transportation of products or of passengers,
of distribution, etc., how do you conceive its functioning?</p>

<p>(5) What will be your relations to your federation of
trade or of industry after your reorganization?</p>

<p>(6) On what principle would the distribution of products
take place and how would the productive groups
procure the raw material for themselves?</p>

<p>(7) What part would the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> play in
the transformed society and what would be their task
with reference to the statistics and to the distribution of
products?</p>

<p>At the Congress of Montpellier, in 1902, a number of
reports were presented answering the above questions.
The reports were in the name of the syndicats and came
from different parts of France. Only a limited number
of them were printed as appendices to the general report
of the Congress. Among them, it may be interesting to
note, was the report of the syndicat of agricultural laborers.
The rest were summed up in the official organ of
the Confederation, <i>La Voix du Peuple</i>.</p>

<p>The reports differed in details. Some emphasized one
point more than another and <i>vice versa</i>. But the general
character of the reports was identical and showed a
consensus of opinion on the main outlines of that &#8220;economic
federalism&#8221; which is the ideal of the syndicalists.</p>

<p>According to this ideal, the syndicat will constitute
the cell of society. It will group the producers of one
and the same trade who will control their means of production.
Property, however, will be social or collective,
and no one syndicat will be the exclusive owner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
of any portion of the collective property. It will merely
use it with the consent of the entire society.</p>

<p>The syndicat will be connected with the rest of society
through its relations with the Federation of its trade,
the <i>Bourse du Travail</i>, and the General Confederation.
With the National Federation relations will be mainly
technical and special, and the rôle of the Federation will
be insignificant. With the General Confederation relations
will be indirect and mainly by mediation of the
<i>Bourse du Travail</i>. Relations with the latter will be of
permanent importance, as the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> will
be the centers of economic activity.</p>

<p>The <i>Bourse du Travail</i>&mdash;in the ideal system of the
syndicalists&mdash;will concentrate all local interests and serve
as a connecting link between a locality and the rest of
the world. In its capacity as local center it will collect
all statistical data necessary for the regular flow of economic
life. It will keep itself informed on the necessities
of the locality and on its resources, and will provide for
the proper distribution of products; as intermediary
between the locality and the rest of the country it will
facilitate the exchange of products between locality and
locality and will provide for the introduction of raw
materials from outside.</p>

<p>In a word, the Bourse will combine in its organization
the character both of local and of industrial autonomy.
It will destroy the centralized political system of the
present State and will counter-balance the centralizing
tendencies of industry.</p>

<p>To the General Confederation will be left only services
of national importance, railways for instance. However,
even in the management of national public utilities
the National Federation and the Bourses will have the
first word. The function of the General Confederation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
will consist mainly in furnishing general information and
in exerting a controlling influence. The General Confederation
will also serve as intermediary in international
relations.</p>

<p>In this social system the State as now constituted will
have no place. Of course, one may call the ideal system
of the syndicalists a State. All depends on the definition
given to the term. But when the syndicalists speak of
the State, they mean an organization of society in which
a delegated minority centralizes in its hands the power
of legislation on all matters. This power may be broken
up and divided among a number of governing bodies,
as in the federal system of the United States, but it does
not thereby change its character. The essential characteristic
of the State is to impose its rule <i>from without</i>.
The legislative assemblies of the present State decide
upon questions that are entirely foreign to them, with
which they have no real connection in life and which they
do not understand. The rules they prescribe, the discipline
they impose, come as an external agency to intervene
in the processes of social life. The State is, therefore,
arbitrary and oppressive in its very nature.</p>

<p>To this State-action the syndicalists oppose a discipline
coming <i>from within</i>, a rule suggested by the processes
of collective life itself, and imposed by those
whose function it is to carry on those processes. It is,
as it were, a specialization of function carried over into
the domain of public life and made dependent upon industrial
specialization. No one should legislate on matters
unless he has the necessary training. The syndicats,
the delegates of the syndicats to the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>,
and so on, only they can properly deal with their respective
problems. The rules they would impose would
follow from a knowledge of the conditions of their social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
functions and would be, so to speak, a &#8220;natural&#8221; discipline
made inevitable by the conditions themselves. Besides,
many of the functions of the existing State would
be abolished as unnecessary in a society based on common
ownership, on co-operative work, and on collective solidarity.
The necessary functions of local administration
would be carried on by the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>.</p>

<p>In recent years, however, revolutionary syndicalists
have not expatiated upon the forms of the future society.
Convinced that the social transformation is inevitable,
they have not thought it necessary to have any ready-made
model upon the lines of which the social organization
of the future should be carved. The revolutionary
classes of the past had no idea of the new social system
they were struggling for, and no ready-made plan is
necessary for the working-class. Prepared by all preliminary
struggle, the workingmen will find in themselves,
when the time comes, sufficient creative power to remake
society. The lines of the future, however, are indicated
in a general way by the development of the present, and
the syndicalist movement is clearly paving the way for an
&#8220;economic federalism&#8221;.</p>

<p>The workingmen are being prepared for their future
rôle by the experiences of syndicalist life. The very struggle
which the syndicats carry on trains the workingmen in
solidarity, in voluntary discipline, in power and determination
to resist oppression, and in other moral qualities
which group life requires. Moreover, the syndicats, particularly
the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>, are centers where educational
activities are carried on. Related to the facts of
life and to the concrete problems of the day, this educational
work, in the form of regular courses, lectures, readings,
etc., is devised to develop the intellectual capacities
of the workingmen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The struggle of the present and the combat of the future
imply the initiative, the example and the leadership
of a conscious and energetic minority ardently devoted
to the interests of its class. The experience of the labor
movement has proven this beyond all doubt. The mass
of workingmen, like every large mass, is inert. It needs
an impelling force to set it in motion and to put to work
its tremendous potential energy. Every strike, every
labor demonstration, every movement of the working-class
is generally started by an active and daring minority
which voices the sentiments of the class to which it
belongs.</p>

<p>The conscious minority, however, can act only by carrying
with it the mass, and by making the latter participate
directly in the struggle. The action of the conscious
minority is, therefore, just the opposite of the action of
parliamentary representatives. The latter are bent on
doing everything themselves, on controlling absolutely
the affairs of the country, and are, therefore, anxious, to
keep the masses as quiet, as inactive and as submissive
as possible. The conscious minority, on the contrary, is
simply the advance-guard of its class; it cannot succeed,
unless backed by the solid forces of the masses; the
awareness, the readiness and the energy of the latter are
indispensable conditions of success and must be kept up
by all means.</p>

<p>The idea of the &#8220;conscious minority&#8221; is opposed to
the democratic principle. Democracy is based upon
majority-rule, and its method of determining the general
will is universal suffrage. But experience has shown
that the &#8220;general will&#8221; is a fiction and that majority-rule
really becomes the domination of a minority&mdash;which
can impose itself upon all and exploit the majority
in its own interests. This is inevitably so, because universal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
suffrage is a clumsy, mechanical device, which
brings together a number of disconnected units and
makes them act without proper understanding of the
thing they are about. The effect of political majorities
when they do make themselves felt is to hinder advance
and to suppress the progressive, active and more developed
minorities.</p>

<p>The practice of the labor movement is necessarily the
reverse of this. The syndicats do not arise out of universal
suffrage and are not the representatives of the
majority in the democratic sense of the term. They
group but a minority of all workingmen and can hardly
expect ever to embrace the totality or even the majority
of the latter. The syndicats arise through a process of
selection. The more sensitive, the intellectually more
able, the more active workingmen come together and
constitute themselves a syndicat. They begin to discuss
the affairs of their trade. When determined to obtain
its demands, the syndicat enters into a struggle, without
at first finding out the &#8220;general will.&#8221; It assumes
leadership and expects to be followed, because it is convinced
that it expresses the feelings of all. The syndicat
constitutes the leading conscious minority.</p>

<p>The syndicat obtains better conditions not for its
members alone, but for all the members of the trade and
often for all the workingmen of a locality or of the country.
This justifies its self-assumed leadership, because
it is not struggling for selfish ends, but for the interests
of all. Besides, the syndicat is not a medieval guild and
is open to all. If the general mass of workingmen do
not enter the syndicats, they themselves renounce the
right of determining conditions for the latter. Benefiting
by the struggles of the minority, they cannot but
submit to its initiative and leadership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
The syndicat, therefore, is not to be compared with
&#8220;cliques,&#8221; &#8220;rings,&#8221; &#8220;political machines,&#8221; and the like.
The syndicat, it must be remembered, is a group of
individuals belonging to the same trade. By this very
economic situation, the members of a syndicat are bound
by ties of common interest with the rest of their fellow-workingmen.
A sense of solidarity and an altruistic
feeling of devotion to community interests must necessarily
arise in the syndicat which is placed in the front
ranks of the struggling workingmen. The leadership of
the syndicalist minority, therefore, is necessarily disinterested
and beneficent and is followed voluntarily by
the workingmen.</p>

<p>Thus, grouping the active and conscious minority the
syndicats lead the workingmen as a class in the struggle
for final emancipation. Gradually undermining the foundations
of existing society, they are developing within
the framework of the old the elements of a new society,
and when this process shall have sufficiently advanced,
the workingmen rising in the general strike will sweep
away the undermined edifice and erect the new society
born from their own midst.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Theorists of Revolutionary Syndicalism</span></h2>

<p>The writers who have contributed to the development
of revolutionary syndicalism may be divided into two
groups. One comprises men who, like Pelloutier,
Pouget, Griffuelhes, Delesalle, Niel, Yvetot and others,
either belong to the working-class, or have completely
identified themselves with the workingmen. The other
consists of a number of &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; who stand outside
of the syndicalist movement.</p>

<p>The members of the first group have played the leading
part in building up the syndicalist movement. Pelloutier
was secretary of the Federation of Bourses from
1894 to 1901; Griffuelhes was secretary of the General
Confederation of Labor from 1901 to 1908; Pouget was
assistant secretary of the Confederation and editor of the
<i>Voix du Peuple</i> from 1900 to 1908; Yvetot has been
one of the secretaries of the Confederation since 1902;
Niel was secretary of the General Confederation for a
short time in 1909, and the others now occupy or have
occupied prominent places in the syndicalist organizations.</p>

<p>The close connection of the members of this group
with the syndicalist movement and with the General
Confederation of Labor has had its influence upon their
writings. Their ideas have been stimulated by close
observation of the facts of syndicalist life, and the course
of their thought has been determined largely by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
struggles of the day. There is a stronger emphasis in
their writings upon methods, upon &#8220;direct action,&#8221; and
upon relations to other existing groups. There is less
speculation and pure theorizing. In other respects the
men of this group differ. They have come from different
political groupings: Pouget and Yvetot, for instance,
from the Communist-Anarchists; Griffuelhes from the
Allemanists. They have different views on the relation
of revolutionary syndicalism to other social theories,
differences which will be brought out further on.</p>

<p>The second group of writers, the so-called &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;
outside the syndicalist movement, have grouped
themselves about the monthly <i>Le Mouvement Socialiste</i>,
started in 1899 by M. Hubert Lagardelle, a member of
the Socialist Party, and about the weekly <i>La Guerre
Sociale</i>, of which Gustave Hervé is editor. <i>Le Mouvement
Socialiste</i> was at first a Socialist monthly review,
but accentuated its sympathy for the syndicalists as time
went on, and became an expressly revolutionary syndicalist
organ in 1904. The <i>Mouvement Socialiste</i> counted
among its constant contributors down to 1910 M.
Georges Sorel and Edouard Berth. These three writers,
Sorel, Lagardelle, and Berth, have tried to systematize
the ideas of revolutionary syndicalism and to put them
on a philosophical and sociological basis. The most
prolific of them and the one who has been proclaimed
&#8220;the most profound thinker of the new school&#8221; is M.
Georges Sorel.</p>

<p>M. Georges Sorel has written on various subjects.
Among the works from his pen are volumes on Socrates,
on <i>The Historical System of Renan</i>, on <i>The Ruin of the
Ancient World</i>, a number of articles on ethics and on
various other topics. The works that bear on revolutionary
syndicalism which alone can be here considered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
are: <i>L'Avenir Socialiste des Syndicats</i>, <i>La Décomposition
du Marxisme</i>, <i>Introduction à l'Économie Moderne</i>, <i>Les
Illusions du Progrès</i>, <i>Réflexions sur la Violence</i>, and a
number of articles in various periodicals.</p>

<p>The works of M. Sorel on revolutionary syndicalism
stretch over a period of ten to twelve years: <i>The Socialist
Future of the Syndicats</i> was written in 1897; the
second edition of his <i>Reflections on Violence</i> appeared in
1910. Within this period of time the thought of M.
Sorel has not only steadily developed in scope but has
also changed in many essential points. It would require
a separate study to point out the changes and their significance.
This is out of the question in this study.
The salient points only of M. Sorel's theories will be
treated here, therefore, without consideration of their
place in the intellectual history of their author.</p>

<p>M. Sorel has attached his theories to the ideas of
Marx. Revolutionary syndicalism is to M. Sorel but the
revival and further development of the fundamental ideas
of Marx. The &#8220;new school&#8221; considers itself, therefore,
&#8220;neo-Marxist,&#8221; true to &#8220;the spirit&#8221; of Marx<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>  though
rejecting the current interpretations of Marx and completing
the lacunae which it finds in Marx. This work
of revision it considers indispensable because, on the one
hand, Marx was not always &#8220;well inspired,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>  and often
harked back to the past instead of penetrating into the
future; and because, on the other hand, Marx did not
know all the facts that have now become known; Marx
knew well the development of the bourgeoisie, but could
not know the development of the labor movement which
has become such a tremendous factor in social life.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
The &#8220;new school&#8221; does not consider itself by any
means bound to admire &#8220;the illusions, the faults, the
errors of him who has done so much to elaborate the
revolutionary ideas.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>  What it retains of Marx is his
essential and fruitful idea of social evolution, namely, that
the development of each social system furnishes the material
conditions for effective and durable changes in the
social relations within which a new system begins its development.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
Accordingly, Socialists must drop all utopian
ideas: they must understand that Socialism is to be
developed gradually in the bosom of capitalism itself and
is to be liberated from within capitalistic surroundings
only when the time is ripe.</p>

<p>The ripening of socialism within capitalism does not
mean merely technical development. This is indispensable
of course: socialism can be only an economic system
based on highly developed and continually progressing
productive forces; but this is one aspect of the case
only. The other, a no less if not more important aspect,
is the development of new moral forces within the old
system; that is, the political, juridical and moral development
of the working-class,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>  of that class which alone
can establish a socialist society.</p>

<p>This was also the idea of Marx: &#8220;Marx also saw that
the workingmen must acquire political and juridical
capacity before they can triumph.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>  The revolution
which the working-class is pursuing is not a simple change
in the personnel or in the form of the government; it is
a complete overthrow of the &#8220;traditional State&#8221; which
is to be replaced by the workingmen's organizations.
Such a complete transformation presupposes &#8220;high moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
culture&#8221; in the workingmen and a capacity for directing
the economic functions of society. The social revolution
will thus come only when the workingmen are &#8220;ready&#8221;
for it, that is, when they feel that they can assume the
direction of society. The &#8220;moral&#8221; education of the
working-class, therefore, is the essential thing; Socialism
will not have to &#8220;organize labor&#8221;, because capitalism
will have accomplished this work before. But in order
that the working-class should be able to behave like &#8220;free
men&#8221; in the &#8220;workshop created by capitalism&#8221;,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>  they
must have developed the necessary capacities. Socialism,
therefore, reduces itself &#8220;to the revolutionary apprenticeship&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
of the workingmen; &#8220;to teaching the workingmen
to will, to instructing them by action, and to revealing
to them their proper capacities; such is the whole
secret of the socialist education of the people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The workingmen can find the moral training necessary
for the triumph of socialism only in the syndicats and in
the experience of syndical life. The syndicats develop
the administrative and organizing capacities of the workingmen.
In the syndicats the workingmen learn to do
their business themselves and to reject the dictatorship
of &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; who have conquered the field of politics
which they have made to serve their ambitions.</p>

<p>The greatest organizing and educating force created
by the syndicalist movement is the idea of the general
strike. The general strike means a complete and &#8220;absolute&#8221;
revolution. It is the idea of a decisive battle
between the bourgeoisie and the working-class assuring
the triumph of the latter. This idea is a &#8220;social myth&#8221;
and hence its tremendous historic force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
&#8220;Social myths&#8221; always arise during great social movements.
The men who participate in great social movements,
represent to themselves their actions in the near
future in the form of images of battles assuring the triumph
of their cause. These images are &#8220;myths.&#8221; The
images of the early Christians on the coming of Christ
and on the ruin of the pagan world are an illustration of
a &#8220;social myth.&#8221; The period of the Reformation saw
the rise of &#8220;social myths,&#8221; because the conditions were
such as to make it necessary for the &#8220;men of heart&#8221;
who were inspired by &#8220;the will of deliverance&#8221; to create
&#8220;images&#8221; which satisfying their &#8220;sentiments of struggle&#8221;
kept up their zeal and their devotion.</p>

<p>The &#8220;social myth&#8221; presupposes a social group which
harbors an intense desire of deliverance, which feels all
the difficulties in its way and which finds deep satisfaction
in picturing to itself its future struggles and future
triumph. Such images must not and cannot be analyzed
like a thing; they must be taken <i>en bloc</i>, and it is particularly
necessary to avoid comparing the real historic
facts with the representations which were in circulation
before the facts took place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Myths&#8221; are indispensable for a revolutionary movement;
they concentrate the force of the rising class and
intensify it to the point of action. No myth can possibly
be free from utopian conceptions. But the utopian
elements are not essential. The essentials are the hope
back of the myth, the ideal strengthened by the myth,
and the impatience of deliverance embodied in the myth.</p>

<p>The general strike is the &#8220;social myth&#8221; of the working-class
longing for emancipation. It is the expression
of the convictions of the working-class &#8220;in the language
of movement,&#8221; the supreme concentration of the desires,
the hopes, and the ideals of the working-class. Its importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
for the future of Socialism, therefore, is paramount.
The idea of the general strike keeps alive and
fortifies in the workingmen their class-consciousness
and revolutionary feelings. Every strike on account of
it assumes the character of a skirmish before the great
decisive battle which is to come. Owing to the general
strike idea, &#8220;socialism remains ever young, the attempts
made to realize social peace seem childish, the desertion
of comrades who run over into the ranks of the bourgeoisie,
far from discouraging the masses, excites them
still more to revolt; in a word, the rupture (between
bourgeoisie and working-class) is never in danger of
disappearing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>This rupture is an indispensable condition of Socialism.
Socialism cannot be the continuation of democracy;
it must be, if it can be at all, a totally &#8220;new culture&#8221;
built upon ideas and institutions totally different
from the ideas and from the institutions of democracy.
Socialism must have its own economic, judicial, political
and moral institutions evolved by the working-class independently
from those of the bourgeoisie, and not in
imitation of the latter.</p>

<p>Sorel is bitter in his criticism of democracy; it is, in
his view, the régime <i>par excellence</i> in which men are
governed &#8220;by the magical power of high-sounding words
rather than by ideas; by formulas rather than by reasons;
by dogmas the origin of which nobody cares to find out,
rather than by doctrines based on observation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>  It is
the kingdom of the professionals of politics, over whom
the people can have no control. Sorel thinks that even
the spread of knowledge does not render the masses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
more capable of choosing and of supervising their so-called
representatives and that the further society advances
in the path of democracy, the less effective does
control by the people become.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>  The whole system of
democracy, in the opinion of M. Sorel, is based on the
&#8220;fiction of the general will&#8221; and is maintained by a
mechanism (campaigning, elections, etc.) which can result
only in demoralization. It delivers the country into
the hands of &#8220;charlatans,&#8221; of office-seekers and of idle
talkers who may assume the air of great men, but who
are never fit for their task.</p>

<p>The working-class must, therefore, break entirely with
democracy and evolve from within itself its own ideas
and original institutions. This complete rupture between
the ideas of the past and those of the future contradicts
the conception of progress now in vogue. But
the conception of progress is rather a deception than a
conception. As held to-day, it is full of illusions, of
errors, and of misconceptions. The idea of progress is
characteristic of democracy and is cherished by the bourgeois
classes because it permits them to enjoy their privileges
in peace. Lulled by the optimistic illusion that
everything is for the best in this best of all worlds, the
privileged classes can peacefully and hopefully pass by
the misery and the disorders of existing society. This
conception of progress, like all other ideas of democracy,
was evolved by the rising middle classes of the eighteenth
century, mainly by the functionaries of royalty
who furnished the theoretical guides of the Revolution.
But, in truth, the only real progress is the development
of industrial technique<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> &mdash;the constant invention of machinery
and the increase of productive forces. The latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
create the material conditions out of which a new culture
arises, completely breaking with the culture of the past.</p>

<p>One of the factors promoting the development of productive
forces is &#8220;proletarian violence.&#8221; This violence
is not to be thought of after the model of the &#8220;Reign
of Terror&#8221; which was the creation of the bourgeoisie.
&#8220;Proletarian violence&#8221; does not mean that there should
be a &#8220;great development of brutality&#8221; or that &#8220;blood
should be shed in torrents&#8221; (<i>versé à flots</i>).<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>  It means
that the workingmen in their struggle must manifest
their force so as to intimidate the employers; it means
that &#8220;the social conflicts must assume the character of
pure struggles similar to those of armies in a campaign.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Such violence will show the capitalist class
that all their efforts to establish social peace are useless;
the capitalists will then turn to their economic interests
exclusively; the type of a forceful, energetic &#8220;captain of
industry&#8221; will be the result, and all the possibilities of
capitalism will be developed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, violence stimulates ever anew the
class-feelings of the workingmen and their sentiments of
the sublime mission which history has imposed upon
them. It is necessary that the revolutionary syndicalists
should feel that they are fulfiling the great and sublime
mission of renovating the world; this is their only compensation
for all their struggles and sufferings. The
feelings of sublimity and enthusiasm have disappeared
from the bourgeois-world, and their absence has contributed
to the decadence of the bourgeoisie. The
working-class is again introducing these feelings by incorporating
them in the idea of the general strike, and
is, therefore, making possible a moral rejuvenation of
the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
All these ideas may seem tinged with pessimism. But
&#8220;nothing very great (<i>très haut</i>) has been accomplished
in this world&#8221; without pessimism.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>  Pessimism is a
&#8220;metaphysics of morals&#8221; rather than a theory of the
world; it is a conception of &#8220;a march towards deliverance&#8221;
and presupposes an experimental knowledge of
the obstacles in the way of our imaginings or in other
words &#8220;a sentiment of social determinism&#8221; and a feeling
of our human weakness.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>  The pessimist &#8220;regards
social conditions as forming a system enchained by an
iron law, the necessity of which must be submitted to as
it is given <i>en bloc</i>, and which can disappear only after a
catastrophe involving the whole.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>  This catastrophic
character the general strike has and must have, if it is
to retain its profound significance.</p>

<p>The catastrophic character of the general strike enhances
its moral value. The workingmen are stimulated
by it to prepare themselves for the final combat by a
moral effort over themselves. But only in such unique
moments of life when &#8220;we make an effort to create a
new man within ourselves&#8221; &#8220;do we take possession of
ourselves&#8221; and become free in the Bergsonian sense of
the term. The general strike, therefore, raises socialism
to the rôle of the greatest moral factor of our time.</p>

<p>Thus, M. Sorel having started out with Marx winds
up with Bergson. The attempt to connect his views
with the philosophy of Bergson has been made by M.
Sorel in all his later works. But all along M. Sorel
claims to be &#8220;true to the spirit of Marx&#8221; and tries to
prove this by various quotations from the works of
Marx. It is doubtful, however, whether there is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
affinity between the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of Marx and that of Professor
Bergson. It appears rather that M. Sorel has
tacitly assumed this affinity because he interprets the
&#8220;spirit&#8221; of Marx in a peculiar and arbitrary way.</p>

<p>Without any pretense of doing full justice to the subject,
three essential points may be indicated which perhaps
sufficiently prove that &#8220;neo-Marxism&#8221; has drifted
so far away from Marx as to lose touch with his &#8220;spirit.&#8221;
These three points bear upon the very kernel of Marxism:
its conception of determinism, its intellectualism,
and its emphasis on the technical factors of social evolution.</p>

<p>The Marxian conception of social determinism is well
known. The social process was thought of by Marx as
rigidly &#8220;necessary,&#8221; as an organic, almost as a mechanical
process. The impression of social necessity one gets
in reading Marx is so strong as to convey the feeling of
being carried on by an irresistible process to a definite
social end.</p>

<p>In M. Sorel's works, on the contrary, social determinism
is a word merely, the concept back of it is not assimilated.
M. Sorel speaks of the general strike and of
Socialism as of possibilities or probabilities, not of necessities.
In reading him, one feels that M. Sorel himself
never felt the irresistible character of the logical category
of necessity.</p>

<p>The difference in the second point follows from the
difference in the first. Marx never doubted the possibility
of revealing the secret of the social process.
Trained in the &#8220;panlogistic school,&#8221; Marx always tacitly
assumed that socialism could be scientific, that the procedure
of science could prove the necessity of social
evolution going in one direction and not in any other.
It was the glory of having given this proof which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
claimed for himself and which has been claimed for him
by his disciples.</p>

<p>M. Sorel is expressly not &#8220;true to the spirit&#8221; of
Marx in this point. &#8220;Science has no way of foreseeing,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
says he. His works are full of diatribes against the pretention
of science to explain everything. He attributes
a large rôle to the unclear, to the subconscious and to
the mystical in all social phenomena. A sentence like
the following may serve to illustrate this point. Says
M. Sorel:</p>

<blockquote><p>Socialism is necessarily a very obscure thing, because it treats
of production&mdash;that is, of what is most mysterious in human
activity&mdash;and because it proposes to realize a radical transformation
in this region which it is impossible to describe
with the clearness which is found in the superficial regions of
the world. No effort of thought, no progress of knowledge,
no reasonable induction will ever be able to dispel the mystery
which envelops Socialism.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This, according to Sorel, is just what &#8220;Marxism has
recognized&#8221;: M. Sorel, certainly, &#8220;knows his Marx.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the third point, M. Sorel &#8220;the revolutionary revisionist,&#8221;
comes very close to M. Bernstein, &#8220;the evolutionary
revisionist.&#8221; The coming of Socialism is made
independent of those technical and economic processes
which Marx so much emphasized. The conceptions of
the concentration of capital, of proletarization, etc., are
given up. On the contrary, Socialism is to be prepared
by the &#8220;revolutionary apprenticeship&#8221; of the working-class,
an apprenticeship to be made in action and under
the influence of a &#8220;social myth&#8221; created by imagination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
spurred on by the subconscious will. There certainly
are pronounced voluntaristic elements in Marx, but this
whole conception of M. Sorel seems to attribute to Marx
a &#8220;spirit&#8221; by no means in harmony with his make-up.</p>

<p>Though claiming to be a disciple of Marx, M. Sorel
seems to be more in harmony with Proudhon whose
works he often quotes and whose views, particularly
on morals, he accepts. But besides Proudhon many
other writers have had a considerable influence on
M. Sorel. Besides Bergson, already mentioned, Renan
and Nietzsche, to quote but two, have had their share of
influence in many of the ideas expressed by M. Sorel.
M. Sorel has an essentially mobile mind quick to catch
an idea and to give it a somewhat new and original turn.
He lacks the ability of systematizing his views and his
reader must have considerable patience with him. The
systematic way in which his views have been given in
this chapter is rather misleading; M. Sorel himself proceeds
in a quite different way; he deals with an idea for
a while but is led away into digression after digression,
to pick up the thread of his previous argument tens of
pages later.</p>

<p>Lack of system makes it easier for contradictions to
live together without detection. It also predisposes a
writer to assimilate and to transform any ideas he may
meet. With Sorel this is evidently so, though his main
claim is &#8220;profundity.&#8221; The pages of his work bristle
with the word <i>approfondir</i> which is so often repeated
that it makes the poor reader dizzy. The disappointment
is sharp, because M. Sorel soon loses the thread
of his thought before having had time to fathom his subject.
His works, however, savor of freshness of thought
and of originality.</p>

<p>Quite a different writer is M. Lagardelle. His exposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
is regular, systematic, fluent, and clear. While
Sorel is mainly interested in the philosophical aspect of
his problems and has been called, probably sarcastically,
by M. Jaurès &#8220;the metaphysician of revolutionary syndicalism,&#8221;
M. Lagardelle considers the economic and
political aspects of the new doctrine. His works need
not be dwelt upon because his ideas do not differ essentially
from those of M. Sorel. Two points, however,
may be singled out; M. Lagardelle, though criticizing
democracy, is careful to point out that Socialism has
been made possible by democracy and that no return to
ancient political forms is desired; secondly, he allows a
place for the political [socialist] party in the general
social system; its rôle is to attend to those problems
which are not entirely included within the domain of industrial
activities.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>While the &#8220;Mouvement Socialiste&#8221; devoted its attention
mainly to the philosophical and sociological aspects
of syndicalism, the weekly <i>La Guerre Sociale</i> took up
questions of policy and method, particularly the questions
of anti-militarism and anti-patriotism. Gustave
Hervé, the editor of the paper, attracted widespread
attention by his attacks on the army and on the idea of
patriotism, and became the <i>enfant terrible</i> of the French
socialist movement because of his violent utterances on
these questions. On other questions of method, M.
Hervé was no less violent being a disciple of the Blanquists
who believed in the efficacy of all revolutionary
methods including the general strike. However, the
theoretical contributions of M. Hervé to the philosophy
of the movement are slight.</p>

<p>Now, what are the relations of the two groups of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
writers described in this chapter and what part has each
played in the history of the movement? These questions
must be carefully considered if a correct understanding
of revolutionary syndicalism is desired.</p>

<p>The view which prevailed outside of France is that
M. Sorel and his disciples &#8220;created&#8221; the theory of revolutionary
socialism in opposition to the parliamentary
socialists, and that they have been able to impress their
ideas upon a larger or smaller portion of the organized
French workingmen. This view was first presented by
Professor W. Sombart in his well-known work on <i>Socialism
and the Social Movement</i>, and has made its way
into other writings on revolutionary syndicalism. M.
Sorel is often spoken of as the &#8220;leader&#8221; of the revolutionary
syndicalists, and the whole movement is regarded
as a form of Marxian revisionism.</p>

<p>This view, however, is a &#8220;myth&#8221; and should be discarded.
French writers who have studied the social
movement of their country and who are competent judges
have tried to dispel the error that has gotten abroad.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
The theorists of the <i>Mouvement Socialiste</i> themselves
have repeatedly declined the &#8220;honor&#8221; which error has
conferred upon them. M. Lagardelle has reiterated
time and again that revolutionary syndicalism was born
of the experience of the labor movement and worked
out by the workingmen themselves. M. Sorel has said
that he learned more from the syndicalist workingmen
than they could learn from him. And in an article reviewing
the book of Professor Sombart, M. Berth has
insisted that Professor Sombart was in error. &#8220;If we
had any part,&#8221; wrote he, &#8220;it was the simple part of interpreters,
of translators, of glossers; we have served as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
spokesmen, that's all; but it is necessary to avoid reducing
to a few propositions of a school, a movement which
is so essentially working-class and the leading ideas of
which, such as direct action and the general strike, are
so specifically of a working-class character.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>This must not be taken as over-modesty on the part
of &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; who are careful not to pose as leaders
or as inspirers. The facts are there to prove the statements
of M. Lagardelle and of M. Sorel. The idea of
the general strike was elaborated by workingmen-members
of the various committees on the general strike.
The idea of &#8220;direct action,&#8221; as has been shown, found
its defenders in the first Congresses of the General Confederation
of Labor. The theory of the social rôle of
the syndicat was formulated by Pelloutier and by other
members of the &#8220;Federation of Bourses&#8221; before M.
Sorel wrote his little book on <i>The Socialist Future of
the Syndicats</i>.</p>

<p>Even the statement of M. Berth must be somewhat
modified. The theorists of the <i>Mouvement Socialiste</i>
have never by any means been the authorized &#8220;spokesmen&#8221;
of the revolutionary syndicalists of the General
Confederation. They were no more than a group of writers
who, watching the syndicalist movement from the outside,
were stimulated by it to their reflections and ideas.
They thought they found in the syndicalist movement
&#8220;a truly original force capable of refreshing the socialist
conception&#8221;, and they formulated their ideas on the subject.
They never took any part in the movement, and
could not feel themselves its representatives.</p>

<p>What then was their influence? In general, the same
as that of other socialist writers. They were and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
read by the French workingmen just as Kropotkin,
Jaurès, Proudhon and other contemporary or former
socialist and anarchist writers, and as many non-socialist
writers are. Naturally, some workingmen came more
under their influence, than under that of others; and
such workingmen may be disposed to look upon them as
their theoretical guides and leaders.</p>

<p>But even the latter interpretation is by no means applicable
to all the theories of M. Sorel, for the main ideas
of Sorel seem fundamentally incapable of inspiring a
movement of large masses. The theory of the &#8220;social
myth&#8221; may be original and attractive, but if accepted by
the workingmen could not inspire them to action. If
&#8220;images of battles&#8221; are important for the &#8220;rising
classes&#8221; as an impelling force, they can be so only so
long as they are naïvely and fully believed in. The worm
of reflection must not touch them. The &#8220;men longing
for deliverance&#8221; must believe that the future will be just
as they picture it, otherwise their enthusiasm for these
pictures would find no nourishment. Should they come
to realize the &#8220;utopian&#8221; and &#8220;mythical&#8221; character of
their constructions they would abandon them.</p>

<p>The pessimistic basis of M. Sorel's <i>Weltanschauung</i>
may appeal to literary men, to students of philosophy
and to individuals longing for a moral theory. It can
not be assimilated by a mass &#8220;moving toward emancipation.&#8221;
When one reads the original documents of the
syndicalist movement, he is struck, on the contrary, by
the powerful torrent of optimism by which the movement
is carried along. Only a strong belief in a &#8220;speedy
emancipation&#8221; created the enthusiasm for the idea of the
general strike. There may be a subconscious pessimism
back of this optimism, but its appearance in the field of
clear consciousness would have been destructive for the
movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
It is, therefore, quite natural that the writers representing
the General Confederation of Labor who address
the workingmen directly do not reproduce these theories
of M. Sorel. As has been indicated already, their writings
bear a different stamp. And if among these writers
some, as for instance M. Griffuelhes, seem to have come
more under the influence of the group <i>Le Mouvement
Socialiste</i>, the rest occupy an independent position even
from the theoretical point of view.</p>

<p>How little M. Sorel could have been the &#8220;leader&#8221; of
the revolutionary syndicalist movement may be illustrated
by the following comparison. At the Congress
of Lyons in 1901 the secretary of the General Confederation
of Labor, M. Guérard, wrote, as we have seen, that
the Confederation is destined to transform society. In
the same year, M. Sorel, in his preface to Pelloutier's
<i>Histoire des Bourses du Travail</i>, wrote: &#8220;The Confederation
of Labor appears to me to be destined to become
an officious Council of Labor, and an academy of proletarian
ideas, which will present its wishes to the government,
as the large agricultural societies do.&#8221; The history
of the General Confederation of Labor since 1902,
to be considered in the following chapter, will show that
M. Sorel missed the point too far to be able to claim the
title of &#8220;leader&#8221; whose function, presumably, is to point
out the way and not to acknowledge it, after it has once
been taken.</p>

<p>It is necessary to bear all this in mind in order to grasp
the real character of revolutionary syndicalism. M. Sorel
has recently renounced his revolutionary syndicalist ideas.
In December, 1910, he wrote to the Italian revolutionary
syndicalists who invited him to their Congress at Boulogne:</p>

<blockquote><p>It seems to the author [of the <i>Reflections on Violence</i>] that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
syndicalism has not realized what was expected from it.
Many hope that the future will correct the evils of the present
hour; but the author feels himself too old to live in distant
hopes; and he has decided to employ the remaining years of
his life in the deepening (<i>approfondir</i>) of other questions
which keenly interest the cultivated youth of France.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Previous to that, M. Sorel and M. Berth had both promised
collaboration in a so-called neo-monarchist monthly,
<i>La Cité Française</i>, which, however, did not see the light.
This probably seemed to them natural in view of their opposition
to democracy. But under the political conditions
of France such an act could not but shock the workingmen
who may criticise democracy but who are bitterly
opposed to everything connected with the <i>ancien régime</i>.
This act of M. Sorel and M. Berth weakened the group
of <i>Le Mouvement Socialiste</i> which, however, is still published
by M. Lagardelle, though with less force and <i>éclat</i>
than before. The act of M. Sorel, however, could have
no perceptible significance for the revolutionary syndicalist
movement. The latter is led by other leaders and is
determined in its march by other influences.</p>

<p>The revolutionary syndicalist ideas embodied in the
movement represented by the General Confederation of
Labor were evolved, as has been shown, in the syndicalist
organizations of France. The Anarchists entering
the syndicats largely contributed to the revolutionary
turn which the syndicats took. Their influence, hailed by
some, deplored by others, is recognized by all. The Anarchists
themselves often speak as if they &#8220;created&#8221; the
entire movement, though this is an exaggeration. The
rôle of the Allemanists has been considerable, as was
shown in the preceding chapters. And the more definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
formulation of revolutionary syndicalist ideas in the period
of &#8220;Millerandism&#8221; was the work of revolutionary socialist
workingmen of all brands&mdash;Allemanists, Anarchists,
Blanquists and others.</p>

<p>This clears up the question of the relation of revolutionary
syndicalism to other social theories. The theorists
of the <i>Mouvement Socialiste</i> have proclaimed revolutionary
syndicalism as a new social theory. They have
been very persistent in trying to delimit their theoretical
dominion from parliamentary socialism on the one hand,
and from Anarchism on the other. From the latter particularly
they wished to be separated, feeling as they did
how dangerously close they came to it. Many workingmen
have accepted this view, proud to proclaim that
they have evolved a theory of their own&mdash;the theory of
the working-class.</p>

<p>Others, however, have taken the correct point of view.
They see that the main ideas of revolutionary syndicalism
cannot be said to be new. They may all be found in the
old &#8220;International Association of Workingmen,&#8221; and
especially in the writings of the Bakounist or federalist
wing of that Association. If not the terms, the ideas
on direct action, on the general strike, on the social rôle
of the syndicat, and on the future &#8220;economic federalism&#8221;
may all be found there more or less clearly stated.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Revolutionary syndicalism appears then, from this
point of view not as a new theory, but as a return to the
old theories of the &#8220;International&#8221; in which the combined
influence of Proudhon, Marx and Bakounin manifested
itself. The formulation of revolutionary syndicalism,
however, is not to any great degree a conscious
return to old ideas, though this conscious factor had its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
part; Pelloutier, for instance, was expressly guided by
the conceptions of Proudhon and Bakounin. References
to the &#8220;International&#8221; are also frequent in the discussions
of the Congresses of the General Confederation.
The more important factors, however, were the conditions
of the French syndical movement itself. The workingmen
of different socialist groups meeting on the
common ground of the syndicat had to attenuate their
differences and to emphasize their common points.
Thus, by a process of elimination and of mutual influence
a common stock of ideas was elaborated which, absorbing
the quintessence of all socialist theories, became
what is known as revolutionary syndicalism. Its similarity
to the ideas of the &#8220;International&#8221; is partly due
to the fact that in the &#8220;International&#8221; similar conditions
existed.</p>

<p>Mainly worked out in the practice of the syndicalist
movement, the ideas of revolutionary syndicalism are
also mainly determined in their further evolution by this
practice. The ideas, therefore, must be judged in connection
with the conditions in which they developed.
These conditions will be further described in the following
chapters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The General Confederation of Labor Since 1902</span></h2>

<p>Before taking up the history of the Confederation
after 1902, a general outline of the constitution adopted
at Montpellier must be given. Passim will be indicated
the changes that have been made since.</p>

<p>The General Confederation of Labor consists of National
Federations of industries and trades,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>  of National
Syndicats, of isolated single syndicats (in that case only
if there is no national or regional federation of the trade,
or if the federation does not adhere to the Confederation),
and of <i>Bourses du Travail</i>, considered as local,
departmental or regional central unions.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Every syndicat adhering to the Confederation must
fulfil the condition of so-called &#8220;double adherence;&#8221;
that is, it must belong to its national federation of industry
or trade, and to the <i>Bourse du Travail</i> of its
locality. Besides, every federation must have at least
one subscription to the <i>Voix du Peuple</i>, which is the
official organ of the Confederation. These conditions,
however, were, and still are disregarded by a considerable
number of syndicats.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The General Confederation is represented by the Confederal
Committee which is formed by delegates of the
adhering organizations. Each organization is represented
by one delegate in the Confederal Committee. This point
should be noticed as it is the cause of struggle within the
Confederation. It means that a large Federation has
only one delegate and one vote in the Confederal Committee,
just as another smaller Federation. The number
of delegates in the Confederal Committee, however,
is not always equal to the number of adhering organizations,
because one delegate may represent as many as
three organizations. The delegates must be workingmen
who have been members of their syndicat for at least a
year.</p>

<p>The General Confederation has five central organs; two
sections and three commissions. The first section is
called: &#8220;The Section of Federations of trades and of industries
and of isolated syndicats;&#8221; the second is &#8220;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Section of the Federation of <i>Bourses du Travail</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>  The
three commissions are (1) the Commission of the journal;
(2) the Commission of strikes and of the general
strike, and (3) the Commission of Control.</p>

<p>The two sections are autonomous in their internal affairs.
The first section is formed by the delegates of the
National Federations of trades and industries. They take
the name of <i>Comité des Fédérations d'industries et de
metiers</i>. This section appoints its own secretary, assistant
secretary, treasurer, assistant treasurer, and archivist,
who form the executive committee of the section. This
section collects monthly from every adhering organization
40 centimes<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>  for every hundred members, or for any
fraction of a hundred; isolated syndicats pay five centimes
monthly for each member.</p>

<p>The Sections of Federations of industries and trades
is convened by its secretary and meets whenever necessary.
Its functions are to promote the organization of
new federations and to maintain relations between the
adhering federations. It takes &#8220;all measures necessary
for the maintenance of syndical action in the field of economic
struggle.&#8221; It also tries to induce isolated syndicats
to join their <i>Bourses du Travail</i>.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Section of the Federation of <i>Bourses du Travail</i>&#8221;
is formed by the delegates of the local, departmental
and regional central unions. The delegates take
the title of <i>Comité des Bourses du Travail</i>.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>  The section
appoints its own secretary, assistant secretary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
treasurer, assistant treasurer, and archivist, and these
five members form the executive committee of the second
section. It collects from the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>
35 centimes monthly for each adhering syndicat.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The second section promotes the creation of new
<i>Bourses du Travail</i> and coördinates the activities of the
adhering Bourses. Its functions embrace &#8220;everything
that bears upon syndical administration and upon the
moral education of the workingmen;&#8221; its task is to
collect statistics of production, of consumption, of unemployment;
to organize gratuitous employment bureaus,
to watch the progress of labor legislation, etc. It
also tries to induce single syndicats to join their national
federations. This section also meets whenever necessary
at the invitation of its secretary.</p>

<p>The Commission of the Journal is composed of twelve
members, six from each section. It appoints its own
secretary. The journal must be edited only by workingmen-members
of the Confederation.</p>

<p>The Commission of strikes and of the general strike
consists also of twelve members, six from each section,
and appoints its own secretary. The functions of this
commission are: to study the strike movement in all
countries, to send speakers and organizers to, and to
collect subscriptions in favor of workingmen on strike,
to make propaganda for the general strike, and to
promote &#8220;the penetration of this idea into the minds
of organized workingmen.&#8221; For this purpose the
commission creates wherever possible sub-committees
of the general strike. This commission has its own
resources which consist of 50 per cent of all money
collected by the sub-committees, and of 50 per cent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of the assessments collected by both sections of the
Confederation.</p>

<p>The Commission of Control is also formed of twelve
members, six from each section; it verifies the financial
reports of both sections and of the other two commissions.
It appoints its own secretary.</p>

<p>The Confederal Committee is formed by the delegates
of both sections. It meets every three months, except
in extraordinary cases. It executes the decisions of the
Congresses, intervenes in all issues concerning the
working-class and decides upon all questions of a general
character.</p>

<p>The Confederal Bureau<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>  consists of thirteen members,
of the ten members of the bureaus of both sections and
of the three secretaries of the three commissions. The
Confederal Bureau summons the Confederal Committee
and executes the decisions of the latter. The secretary
of the &#8220;Section of Federations&#8221; is the general secretary
of the Confederation. The Confederal Bureau is renewed
after every Congress, that is every two years,
but functionaries whose terms have expired may be re-elected.</p>

<p>Article 37 of the statutes adopted read: &#8220;The General
Confederation of Labor, based on the principles of federalism
and of liberty, assures and respects the complete
autonomy of the organizations which conform to the
present statutes.&#8221; The <i>Bourses du Travail</i> and the
Federations of industries and of trades were, therefore,
to pursue independently the activities that concerned
them alone. The <i>Bourses du Travail</i> continued in the
main the activities described in the third chapter. Their
growth was steady both in number of organizations and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
in membership, as may be seen from the following table:</p>

</table></div>

<p>After 1906 Bourses of the same region or Department
began to form regional and Departmental Unions in
order to coördinate their activities and to influence
larger groups of the working population. This has led
to the process described above, which is transforming
the basis of representation in the General Confederation
of Labor.</p>

<p>In matters of administration the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>
have made a step in advance since the early part of the
century. They have succeeded in organizing the <i>viaticum</i>
(aid to workingman traveling from town to town
in search of work) on a national basis, and have amplified
their services as employment bureaus. They are now
systematizing their statistical work by making monthly
and quarterly reports on the state of employment in their
locality, on strikes, on the growth of organization, and
on other industrial matters of interest. Their financial
situation has been considerably improved, and in a number
of cities they have left the municipal buildings and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
have built their own &#8220;people's houses&#8221; (<i>maisons du
peuple</i>).</p>

<p>Regard for matters of administration has not diminished
the zeal of the Bourses for anti-militaristic propaganda.
Most of them have organized in recent years
the so-called <i>Sou du Soldat</i> (Soldier's Penny). They
send financial aid to workingmen who are doing military
service, invite them to the social gatherings of the syndicats,
distribute syndicalist literature among them, and
in all ways try to maintain in the soldiers a feeling of
solidarity with the organized workers.</p>

<p>The Federations of industries and trades after 1902
concentrated their attention upon their particular trade
and industrial interests. The story of these Federations
is the story of organization, education, and strikes which
can not be told here in detail.</p>

<p>While the Bourses and industrial federations attended
to the particular, local and administrative interests of
their respective organizations, the General Confederation
of labor intervened or took the initiative in questions
that interested all or a considerable part of all workingmen.
The new statutes went into force on January 1,
1903. The elections secured the predominance of the
revolutionary syndicalists in the Confederal Committee;
Griffuelhes was elected secretary of the Confederation;
Pouget, assistant; Yvetot, secretary of the Section of
Bourses. In October of the same year the Confederal
Committee was summoned to an extraordinary meeting
to consider the question of the suppression of employment
bureaus. This question had agitated a considerable
part of the working-class for many years. The workingmen
had protested time and again against the methods
and procedure of these bureaus, and their protests had
been found to be well founded by all who investigated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the matter.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>  The methods of the employment bureaus
had been condemned in Parliament, and the Chamber
had passed a bill to suppress the employment bureaus
with indemnity in 1901-2. The Senate, however, rejected
it in February, 1902, and the question was dropped indefinitely.</p>

<p>The workingmen of the food-producing industries
(<i>alimentation</i>) were particularly interested in the suppression
of the employment bureaus. In October, 1903,
exasperated by the fact that twenty-five years of lobbying
and of petitioning had produced no results, they
decided to take the matter into their own hands. October
29th, a &#8220;veritable riot&#8221; took place in the <i>Bourse
du Travail</i> of Paris, the police used their arms, and
many were wounded on both sides.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>The Confederal Committee decided to lend its help to
the workingmen in the struggle. It appointed a special
committee to direct the movement. The plan adopted
was to carry on a wide agitation for some time and then
to arrange protest-meetings on the same day in all industrial
centers of France. December 5, 1903, hundreds
of meetings were held all over France, at which the same
demand was made that the employment offices be abolished.
The meetings were arranged with the help of the
<i>Bourses du Travail</i> which appear in all such cases as the
centers of agitation.</p>

<p>November 5, 1903, the Chamber, by 495 votes against
14, voted a law suppressing the Employment Bureaus
within a period of five years, with an indemnity of six
million francs. In February, 1904, the law passed the
Senate with some modifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
The agitation for the suppression of the employment
bureaus appeared to all as a manifestation of the new
theories on &#8220;Direct Action.&#8221; &#8220;The socialist syndicats
have wrested the vote of the Chamber by the pressure
of rebellion (<i>Coup d'émeutes</i>)&#8221; wrote the <i>Journal des
Économistes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>  The revolutionary syndicalists themselves
considered the agitation as an illustration of their methods,
and the success obtained as a proof of the efficiency
of the latter. The report to the Congress of Bourges
(1904) read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Under the pressure of the workingmen the Government, till
then refractory to the reform, capitulated.... To-day it is
an accomplished fact; wherever syndicalist action was exercised
with perseverance and energy, the employment bureaus
have gone. This fact is characteristic. The General Confederation
has the merit, thanks to the immense effort of the
interested themselves, of having obtained a reform in a relatively
short time, if it is compared with the slowness with
which everything concerning the workingmen is done.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The policy of the General Confederation, however, had
opponents within the Confederation itself. A struggle
for supremacy between the two tendencies was inevitable,
and it took place at the very next Congress of the Confederation
at Bourges (1904).</p>

<p>The report presented to the Congress of Bourges
showed that the Confederation had made considerable
progress since 1902. It counted now 53 Federations of
industries and trades, and National syndicats (against 30
in 1902), 15 isolated syndicats, and 110 <i>Bourses du Travail</i>,
a total of 1,792 syndicats (against 1,043 in 1902),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
with 150,000 members. The Section of Federations of
industries had received in dues for the two years, 11,076
francs; its total budget amounted to 17,882 francs; the
Section of <i>Bourses du Travail</i> had collected in dues
9,016 francs and had a total budget of 12,213 francs.
The <i>Voix du Peuple</i> was now self-supporting, and had
increased the number of its subscriptions. The Congress
of Bourges, for the first time, was organized on
the financial resources of the syndicats without municipal
or governmental subsidies.</p>

<p>It was known before that the Congress of Bourges
would discuss the question of methods, and both sides,
the revolutionary syndicalists and those who were called
&#8220;reformists,&#8221; made all efforts possible to obtain a majority
at the Congress. There were 1,178 mandates
from as many syndicats. This was the system of representation
adopted by the Statutes of the Confederation
in 1902. At its Congress the Confederation resolves
itself into an association of syndicats; the Federations
and Bourses disappear and their constituent elements,
the syndicats, take their place. Each syndicat&mdash;no matter
how large or how small&mdash;has one vote; and one delegate
may represent as many as ten syndicats. At the
Congress of Bourges the 1,178 mandates were distributed
among 400 delegates, of whom 350 came from
the Provinces and 50 from Paris.</p>

<p>The attack on the Confederal Committee was led by
M. Keufer, the delegate and secretary of the Typographical
Union (<i>La Fédération du Livre</i>). He accused the
Confederal Committee of violating the statutes, of being
partial and biased and of trying in every way to harm
the <i>Fédération du Livre</i>, because the latter pursued
&#8220;reformist&#8221; methods. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said M. Keufer, &#8220;we
prefer the reformist method, because we believe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
direct and violent action, commended by the anarchists,
will cost thousands of workingmen their lives, without
assuring durable results.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>  He insisted that it was
necessary to try conciliatory methods before declaring
strikes and to solicit the help of representatives in the
legislative bodies. He showed that, on the one hand,
even the revolutionary syndicalists were compelled by
circumstances to use such methods, while the <i>Fédération
du Livre</i>, on the other hand, did not shrink from strikes
and from direct action, when that was inevitable. M.
Keufer was supported by M. Lauche, the delegate of the
machinists, and by M. Guérard, the delegate of the railway
workers.</p>

<p>The accusations of the &#8220;reformists&#8221; were repudiated
by a number of revolutionary syndicalists who reaffirmed
in their speeches adherence to the ideas, described in the
preceding chapters, on the State, on direct action, etc.
They were the victors, and the report of the Confederal
Committee was approved by 812 votes against 361 and
11 blank.</p>

<p>The main struggle, however, centered on the question
of proportional representation. This question had been
brought up at previous Congresses by the delegates of
some larger syndicats. At one time even some of the
revolutionary syndicalists had advocated proportional
representation as a means of finding out the real strength
of the various tendencies in the Confederation. But
after the Confederation became decidedly revolutionary,
the revolutionary syndicalists became decidedly opposed
to proportional representation which they now regarded
as a move on the part of the &#8220;reformist&#8221; element to
obtain control of the Confederation.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Proportional representation was defended by the delegates
of the Typographical Union, of the Machinists and
of the Railway Workers. They criticised the statutes
adopted at Montpellier which gave every organization,
regardless of its numbers, one vote only in the Confederal
Committee. This system, they declared, vitiated
the character of the Confederation, and gave predominance
to the minority. They claimed that the delegates
in the Confederal Committee expressed the opinions
shared by a small proportion only of the organized
workingmen and that the Confederation was, therefore,
a tool in the hands of a few &#8220;turbulent&#8221; individuals.
They demanded that some system of proportional representation
should be adopted which should give every
organization a number of votes in the Confederal Committee
proportional to the number of its members.</p>

<p>The opponents of proportional representation argued
that this system would stifle the small syndicats; that all
syndicats were of equal value from the point of view of
the economic struggle, because small syndicats often
achieve as much, and even more, than large ones; they
pointed out that proportional representation would make
necessary continual changes in the number of delegates
in the Confederal Committee, because the effective force
of the syndicats is in constant flux and that it would be
impossible to find out the true figures. They claimed
that proportional representation could not be applied to
economic life, because it was no fault of any one trade or
industry if only a few thousand workers were employed in
it, while other industries required hundreds of thousands
of workingmen. Even from the point of view of strength,
they argued, a small syndicat may have more value than
a large one because it may embrace a larger proportion
of workingmen employed in the trade. The opponents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of proportional representation repudiated the assertion
that only the small syndicats were with them and pointed
out that some of the largest federations, as the Metallurgical
Federation with 11,500 members, the Federation
of Marine with 12,000 members and others, were
against proportional representation.</p>

<p>The opponents of proportional representation carried
the day and the proposition of &#8220;reformist&#8221; delegates
was rejected by a vote of 822 against 388 (one abstained).</p>

<p>The Congress of Bourges thus sanctioned the revolutionary
character of the Confederation. The &#8220;reformists&#8221;
frankly admitted that they had suffered a defeat and attributed
it to the fact that two-thirds of the delegates were
new men in the movement and under the influence of the
anarchists.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>  The revolutionary syndicalists triumphed,
and extolled the historical significance of the Congress
of Bourges which, in their opinion, was a &#8220;landmark&#8221;
in the history of syndicalism.</p>

<p>The Congress of Bourges adopted a resolution which
was to concentrate the attention of the Confederation
for the next two years on one question: an eight-hour
working day. The Committee appointed by the Congress
to consider the question reported that two ways of
obtaining an eight-hour day had been indicated. One
proposed to prepare a bill to be presented to the public
authorities and to organize public meetings in order to
show the government that public opinion demanded the
passage of the law. This method was rejected by the
Committee because ever since 1889, workingmen had
presented such petitions to the public authorities on the
first of May, but without any results whatsoever.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the other &#8220;direct&#8221; method which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
recommended the workingmen to &#8220;hold aloof&#8221; from
the public authorities, and to exert all possible pressure
&#8220;on their adversaries&#8221; was adopted by the Committee.
The Committee argued that the experience with the employment
agencies had shown that this method gave
better results. The report of the Committee read:</p>

<blockquote><p>If the recent campaign has resulted in the suppression of the
employment bureaus, it is because the movement was becoming
dangerous.</p>

<p>Every day employment bureaus were abolished, anonymous
violence was committed against the owners of the offices
(<i>placeurs</i>), a considerable number of shops were damaged,
numerous collisions took place between the police and the
workingmen, Paris was in a state of siege, and it was in order
to calm this agitation that Parliament voted a law making it
permissive for the municipalities to abolish the employment
bureaus.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Committee, therefore, recommended that the
same method be used to obtain an eight-hour day, that
big manifestations be organized all over France on the
1st of May, 1905, and that afterwards an active propaganda
be carried on by a special commission appointed
for that purpose by the Confederal Committee &#8220;in order
that beginning with the 1st of May, 1906, no workingman
should consent to work more than eight hours a
day nor for a wage below the minimum established by
the interested organizations.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>  The recommendation of
the Committee was adopted by the Congress with an
amendment of Pouget which still more emphasized the
&#8220;direct&#8221; method to be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
To carry out the decisions of the Congress, the Confederal
Committee appointed a special commission to
direct the movement for an eight-hour day. The Commission
sent out a questionnaire to all syndical organizations,
asking all those who were in favor of the movement
to lend their help. A number of manifestoes,
posters and pamphlets were published and spread abroad
in tens of thousands of copies in which the meaning of
the movement and its importance were explained. In
the trade-journals, in the cars, in the streets, and wherever
possible, brief mottoes were posted, such as:
&#8220;Eight hours of work means more rest and more
health,&#8221; &#8220;To work more than eight hours means to
lower your wages,&#8221; etc. On the <i>Bourse du Travail</i> of
Paris a big placard was put up with the words: &#8220;From
the first of May, 1906, we shall not work more than
eight hours.&#8221; Delegates were sent out on repeated
tours into the province to carry on the propaganda and
agitation. On the first of May, 1905, over 150 meetings
were arranged in different parts of France at which the
question of the eight-hour day was considered.</p>

<p>As May 1, 1906, neared, the agitation in the country
became more and more intense. A number of events
helped to increase the agitation. In March, 1906, a
catastrophe occurred in the mining districts of Northern
France which resulted in the loss of workingmen's lives.
A strike accompanied by violence followed. In April,
the letter carriers of Paris struck, causing some disorganization
in the service for a few days.</p>

<p>Toward the end of April the number of strikes and
manifestations increased in Paris. The agitation was
exploited by the enemies of the government and particularly
by the monarchist papers. The Government of
M. Clemenceau, on the other hand, tried to discredit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
movement by spreading rumors that a plot against the
Republic had been discovered in which monarchists and
leaders of the Confederation were involved. The <i>Voix
du Peuple</i> published a protest of the Confederal Committee
against this accusation. Nevertheless the government
searched at the same time the houses of Monarchists,
Bonapartists and of leading members of the
Confederation, and on the eve of the first of May, it
arrested Griffuelhes, Pouget, Merrheim and other syndicalists
together with a number of well-known monarchists.</p>

<p>The first of May found Paris in a state of siege.
Premier Clemenceau had collected numerous troops in
the capital. Since the days of the Commune Paris had
not seen so many. Among the bourgeoisie a real panic
reigned. Many left Paris and crossed the Channel.
Those who remained in Paris made provision for food
for days to come. The papers spoke of the &#8220;coming
revolution&#8221; which the General Confederation of Labor
was to let loose on society.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>The strike movement was very wide. According to
official statistics, the agitation of the Confederation
affected 2,585 industrial establishments and involved
202,507 workingmen. The sweep of the movement may
be grasped from the following table giving the statistics
of strikes in France since 1892:

<p>The movement assumed various forms in different
trades. The printers, for instance, pursued their conciliatory
methods and obtained a nine-hour day in about
150 towns. In some trades the strikes developed a more
or less acute character and continued for several months
after the first of May.</p>

<p>Some of the &#8220;reformists&#8221; declared that the movement
was a complete failure.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>  According to official statistics,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
the results of the strike movement were as follows:</p>

The revolutionary syndicalists did not claim much
material success, but they argued that this had not been
expected. The main purpose of the movement, they asserted,
was, &#8220;by an immense effort, to spread among the
large mass of workingmen the ideas which animate the
militant groups and the syndical organizations. The
problem to be solved, at first, was, thus, by means of a
vigorous propaganda to reach the workingmen who had
remained indifferent to the syndicalist movement.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
And this task, in the opinion of the revolutionary syndicalists,
had been accomplished. The agitation had
aroused the workingmen in all parts of France.</p>

<p>In September, 1906, the Congress of the Confederation
met at Amiens. The report of the secretary showed
continued progress of the Confederation since 1904.
The Section of Federations of industries now counted 61
federal organizations with 2,399 syndicats and 203,273
members. The dues collected by this section for the
two years amounted to 17,650 francs; and its total
budget to 20,586 francs. The section of the Federation
of Bourses consisted now of 135 Bourses with 1,609
syndicats; it collected in dues 11,821 francs, and had a
total budget of 15,566 francs.</p>

<p>The report of the Confederal Committee again called
forth the attacks of &#8220;reformist&#8221; syndicalists, but was
approved by 781 votes against 115 (21 blank and 10
contested). But the main question which absorbed the
largest part of the work of the Congress was the relation
of the General Confederation of Labor to the
Socialist Party.</p>

<p>This question had again assumed a new character. The
International Socialist Congress of Amsterdam (1904)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
had exhorted and advised the French Socialists to accomplish
as soon as possible the unification of their separate
parties into one national Socialist Party. In April,
1905, a &#8220;Congress of Unification&#8221; was held at Paris, at
which the <i>Parti Socialiste de France</i> and the <i>Parti Socialiste
Français</i> formed the <i>Parti Socialiste Unifié</i>. A
common program was accepted and a new form of organization
elaborated. At its first Congress in Chalons in
October, 1905, the Unified Party counted 35,000 paying
members distributed in 2,000 groups, 67 federations and
77 departments. In the elections of 1906 the Unified
Party obtained an increase of votes and elected 54 members
to Parliament.</p>

<p>It now seemed to many that there was no reason for
the General Confederation of Labor to keep aloof from
the Socialist Party. The reason heretofore given was
that the divisions in the Socialist Party disorganized the
syndicats, but since the Socialist Party was now unified,
the reason lost all significance, and it seemed possible to
establish some form of union between the two organizations.
The question was taken up soon after the unification
of the Socialist Party by the &#8220;Federation of Textile
Workers&#8221; who had it inserted in the program of the
coming Congress of Amiens. The question was discussed
for some time before the Congress in the socialist and
syndicalist press, and the decision that would be taken
could have been foreseen from the discussion.</p>

<p>M. Renard, the Secretary of the &#8220;Federation of Textile
Workers,&#8221; defended the proposition that permanent
relations should be established between the General Confederation
and the Unified Socialist Party. His argument
was that in the struggle of the working-class for
emancipation, various methods must be used, and that
various forms of organization were accordingly necessary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
The syndicat, in his opinion, could not suffice for
all purposes; it was an instrument in economic struggles
against employers, but by the side of this economic
action, political action must be carried on to obtain protective
labor legislation. For this purpose he considered
it necessary to maintain relations with the Socialist
Party, which had &#8220;always proposed and voted laws having
for their object the amelioration of the conditions of
the working-class as well as their definitive emancipation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Besides, argued M. Renard, &#8220;if a revolutionary
situation should be created to-day,&#8221; the syndicats now in
existence, with their present organization could not &#8220;regulate
production and organize exchange,&#8221; and &#8220;would
be compelled to make use of the machinery of the government.&#8221;
The co-operation of the Confederation with
the Socialist Party, therefore, was useful and necessary
from the point of view both of the present and of the
future.</p>

<p>M. Renard repudiated the accusation that he meant to
introduce politics into the syndicats or to fuse the latter
in the Socialist Party. On the contrary, he accused the
Confederal Committee of carrying on political agitation
under the cover of neutrality. Against this &#8220;special
politics&#8221; his proposition was directed. &#8220;When anti-militarism
is carried on,&#8221; said M. Renard, &#8220;when anti-patriotism
is indulged in, when [electoral] abstention is
preached, it is politics.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>  This anarchistic policy has
prevailed since the &#8220;libertarians have invaded the Confederation
and have transformed the latter into a war-engine
against the Socialist Party. The Federation of
Textile Workers wants to put an end to the present state
of affairs.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
The proposition of the Textile workers was combated
by revolutionary and &#8220;reformist&#8221; syndicalists alike. M.
Keufer, who had bitterly attacked the revolutionary syndicalists
at Bourges (1904), now fought the political
syndicalists. He agreed with M. Renard that political
action was necessary though he did not place &#8220;too great
hopes in legislative action and in the intervention of the
State;&#8221; still he thought that the latter was inevitable,
and alluded to the fact that the revolutionary syndicalists
themselves were constantly soliciting the intervention of
the public authorities. But to secure a successful parallel
economic and political action, M. Keufer believed that it
was better for the Confederation to remain entirely independent
of the Socialist Party, and he proposed a resolution
repudiating both &#8220;anarchist and anti-parliamentarian
agitation&#8221; and permanent relations with any
political party.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The revolutionary syndicalists in their turn criticised
the part assigned to the syndicat both by the political
syndicalists and by the &#8220;reformists.&#8221; They emphasized
the &#8220;integral&#8221; and revolutionary rôle of the syndicat
which makes it unnecessary and dangerous to conclude
any alliance with any political party. They denied that
the Confederal Committee was carrying on an anarchist
propaganda. Said M. Griffuelhes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Keufer insists very much on the presence of libertarians in the
Confederal Committee; they are not so numerous as the
legend has it; this is only a stratagem to arouse the fear of
an anarchist peril which does not exist. On the contrary, the
vitality of the Confederation is the result of a co-operation of
various political elements. When, after the entrance of M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Millerand into the government, the latter began its policy of
&#8220;domesticating&#8221; the workingmen, a coalition of Anarchists,
Guesdists, Blanquists, Allemanists and other elements took
place in order to isolate the government from the syndicats.
This coalition has maintained itself and has been the very life
of the Confederation.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The proposition of the Textile Federation was rejected
by 724 votes against 34 (37 blank). The defeat
for the political syndicalists was complete. By an overwhelming
majority of 830 against 8 (one blank), the
Congress adopted the following proposition of Griffuelhes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Confederal Congress of Amiens confirms article 2 of
the constitution of the General Federation.</p>

<p>The C. G. T. groups, independent of all political schools,
all the workingmen who are conscious of the struggle to be
carried on for the disappearance of the wage system....</p>

<p>The Congress considers that this declaration is a recognition
of the class struggle which, on an economic basis, places
the workingmen in revolt against all forms of exploitation
and oppression, material and moral, put into operation by the
capitalist class against the working-class.</p>

<p>The Congress makes this theoretic affirmation more precise
by adding the following points:</p>

<p>With regard to the every-day demands, syndicalism pursues
the coördination of the efforts of the workingmen, the
increase of the workingmen's welfare through the realization
of immediate ameliorations, such as the diminution of working
hours, the increase of wages, etc.</p>

<p>But this is only one aspect of its work; syndicalism is preparing
the integral emancipation which can be realized only
by the expropriation of the capitalist class; it commends as a
means to this end the general strike, and considers that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
syndicat, now a group of resistance, will be in the future the
group of production and of distribution, the basis of social
organization.</p>

<p>The Congress declares that this double task of every-day
life and of the future follows from the very situation of the
wage-earners, which exerts its pressure upon the working-class
and which makes it a duty for all workingmen, whatever their
opinions or their political and philosophical tendencies, to belong
to the essential group which is the syndicat; consequently,
so far as individuals are concerned, the Congress declares entire
liberty for every syndicalist to participate, outside of the
trade organization, in any forms of struggle which correspond
to his philosophical or political ideas, confining itself only to
asking of him, in return, not to introduce into the syndicat
the opinions which he professes outside of it.</p>

<p>In so far as organizations are concerned, the Congress decides
that, in order that syndicalism may attain its maximum
effectiveness, economic action should be exercised directly
against the class of employers, and the Confederal organizations
must not, as syndical groups, pay any attention to parties
and sects which, outside and by their side, may pursue in full
liberty the transformation of society.</p></blockquote>

<p>The vote on this resolution showed that all parties interpreted
the resolution in their own way. To the &#8220;reformists&#8221;
it meant complete political neutrality, to the political
syndicalist it emphasized the liberty of political action
outside the syndicat; the revolutionary syndicats saw in
the resolution the &#8220;Charter of French Syndicalism&#8221; in
which their theories were succinctly formulated.</p>

<p>After the Congress of Amiens the General Confederation
continued its policy of direct action. During 1907
it helped the movement for a law on a weekly rest (<i>Repos
Hebdamodaire</i>) which was carried on by the commercial
employees and by workingmen of certain trades. The
movement expressed itself often in street demonstrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and riotous gatherings and brought the Confederation
into conflict with the government.</p>

<p>The government of M. Clemenceau took a determined
attitude towards the Confederation. Papers like the
<i>Temps</i> called upon the government to dissolve the Confederation.
&#8220;Against syndicalism,&#8221; wrote the <i>Temps</i>,
&#8220;are valid all the arguments of law and of fact as against
anarchy.&#8221; Members of the Confederal Committee were
arrested here and there for incendiary speeches and for
anti-militaristic propaganda. In the Chamber of Deputies
the Confederation was the subject of a heated debate
which lasted several days, and in which radicals, conservatives,
socialists, and members of the government
took part.</p>

<p>The Confederal Committee in its turn vehemently attacked
the government. In June, 1907, troubles occurred
among the wine-growers in the south of France, and
blood was shed. The Confederal Committee launched a
manifesto against the government with the heading,
&#8220;Government of Assassins,&#8221; in which it praised one of
the regiments that had refused to shoot into the crowd
at the order of the officers.</p>

<p>The government instituted legal proceedings against
twelve members of the Confederal Committee for &#8220;insults
to the army.&#8221; The trial took place in February,
1908; all the accused were acquitted.</p>

<p>In June, 1908, a strike in one of the towns near Paris,
Draveuil, occasioned the intervention of the police.
Shooting took place, one workingman was killed, one
mortally wounded, and several others severely wounded.
On the 4th of June the Confederal Committee published
a protest calling the government &#8220;a government of
assassins&#8221; and Premier Clemenceau, &#8220;Clemenceau the
murderer&#8221; (<i>Clemenceau le Tueur</i>) and called upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
syndicats to protest against the action of the government.
As the strike in Draveuil was among workingmen
of the building trades, the &#8220;Federation of the Building
Trades,&#8221; the most revolutionary syndical organization
in France, took the lead in the movement, seconded by
the Confederal Committee. Manifestations took place
at the funerals of the killed workingmen in Draveuil and
Villeneuve St. George (neighboring communes) in which
bloody collisions with the police were avoided with difficulty.
The &#8220;Federation of the Building Trades&#8221; and
many members of the Confederal Committee advocated
a general strike as a protest against the action of the
government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the strike at Draveuil was going on. On
the 27th of July a collision between the police and the
strikers again took place, and the &#8220;Federation of Building
Trades&#8221; decided upon a general strike and upon a
demonstration for the 30th of July. Some members of
the Confederal Committee, the Secretary Griffuelhes, for
instance, were opposed to the manifestation, but the
decision was taken against their advice.</p>

<p>The manifestation of Villeneuve St. George resulted in
a violent collision; there were many killed and wounded.
The agitation grew, and the Confederal Committee together
with the federal committee of the Building Trades
called upon the other trades to join them in a general
strike to be continued as a protest against the &#8220;massacres.&#8221;
The call of the Confederal Committee was only
partly followed.</p>

<p>The events of Villeneuve St. George aroused the press
and the government against the Confederation. The
&#8220;Confederal Committee,&#8221; wrote the <i>Temps</i>, &#8220;is not an
instrument for trade conquests. It is a purely insurrectional
Committee. It should be treated as such.&#8221; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
government arrested all the leading members of the
Confederal Committee.</p>

<p>On the 4th of August, as a move against the government,
the Confederal Committee which constituted itself
after the arrests and of which M. Luquet was temporary
secretary, admitted the Federation of Miners with 60,000
members into the Confederation. The Federation of
Miners had for some time expressed its wish to enter the
Confederation, but certain difficulties, more or less personal,
had stood in the way. After Villeneuve St.
George these difficulties were smoothed and the adherence
of the Miners to the Confederation was made possible.</p>

<p>The events of Villeneuve St. George aroused some
protests within the Confederation. The collisions and
the bloodshed were ascribed by the opponents of the
Confederal Committee to revolutionary methods and
&#8220;anarchist&#8221; tactics. The polemics between the &#8220;reformist&#8221;
and &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; elements which had not
ceased since the Congress of Amiens now became more
and more bitter.</p>

<p>In September, 1908, the Congress of the Confederation
met at Marseilles. The reports to the Congress
showed that the Section of Federations of industries
counted 68 federal organizations with 2,586 syndicats
and 294,398 members; total receipts amounted to 24,719
francs. The Section of Bourses counted 157 <i>Bourses
du Travail</i> with 2,028 syndicats and with a budget of
16,081 francs.</p>

<p>The Congress of Marseilles expressed its sympathy
with the arrested members of the Confederation, and
&#8220;denounced before the entire public the abominable procedures&#8221;
of the government. The reports of the Confederal
Committee were approved by 947 with none
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
against and 109 blanks, &#8220;not because the members of
the Confederal Bureau were arrested, but because the
acts of the Bureau and of the Confederal Committee
were the expression of the mandate entrusted to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Congress of Marseilles rejected the proposition to
apply the principle of proportional representation which
was again advanced. It discussed the question of industrial
and trade unionism and decided in favor of the
former, inviting all trade federations to fuse into industrial
federations.</p>

<p>But the main question which agitated the Congress
was that of anti-militarism. At Amiens (1906) an anti-militaristic
resolution introduced by Yvetot (Secretary
of the Section of <i>Bourses du Travail</i>) had been passed.
But it was passed in a hurry, as there was no time to
discuss it, and it raised strong opposition among the
&#8220;reformist&#8221; elements. It was taken to the Congress of
Marseilles, therefore, for another discussion.</p>

<p>The Congress of Marseilles accepted the resolution
introduced by Yvetot. The resolution read:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Congress of Marseilles, repeats and renders more precise
the decision of Amiens, namely:</p>

<p>Considering that the army tends more and more to take
the place of the workingmen on strike in the factory, in the
fields, in the workshop, when it has not the function of shooting
them, as in Narbonnes, Raon-L'Etape, and Villeneuve
St. George;</p>

<p>Considering that the exercise of the right to strike will be
only a fraud as long as the soldiers agree to substitute the
workers in civil work and to massacre the workingmen; the
Congress, keeping within purely economic limits, recommends
the instruction of the recruits (<i>jeunes</i>) in order that on the
day when they put on the military uniform they should be
convinced that they should remain nevertheless members of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the family of workingmen and that in the conflict between
capital and labor their duty is not to use their arms against
their brethren, the workingmen;</p>

<p>Considering that the geographical boundaries are modifiable
at the will of the possessors, the workingmen recognize
only the economic boundaries separating the two class-enemies&mdash;the
working-class and the capitalist class.</p>

<p>The Congress repeats the formula of the International:
&#8220;The workingmen have no fatherland;&#8221; and adds:</p>

<p>That whereas, consequently, every war is but an outrage
(<i>attentat</i>) against the workingmen; that it is a bloody and
terrible means of diverting them from their demands, the
Congress declares it necessary, from the international point of
view, to enlighten the workingmen, in order that in case of
war they may reply to the declaration of war by a declaration
of a revolutionary general strike.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The resolution was adopted by 681 votes against 421
and 43 blank. Many voted against the resolution because
of its anti-patriotic character, though they accepted
the part bearing upon the use of the army in strikes.</p>

<p>In November, 1909, the government freed the arrested
members of the Confederal Committee, but they did not
regain their former positions of authority. In February,
1909, the &#8220;reformist&#8221; elements succeeded in electing as
secretary of the Confederation their candidate, M. Niel,
who was once a revolutionary but had become more
moderate. M. Niel was elected by a majority of one
vote, and his position was very difficult in the Confederal
Committee. He aimed, as he expressed it, to bring about
&#8220;moral unity&#8221; in the Confederation, but was
hampered in his activities by the revolutionaries and not
sufficiently supported by the &#8220;reformists.&#8221;</p>

<p>In March, 1909, the Post Office employees went on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
strike. The Confederation took no part in the movement
but invited the workingmen to sympathize with
the strikers. The strike was successful, and the government
promised to consider the grievances of the Post
Office employees whose main demand was the removal of
the Secretary of the Department.</p>

<p>The promises of the government were unofficial, and the
strikers after some time claimed that the government had
not kept its word. A second strike followed in May, but
there was less enthusiasm among the employees, and a
failure was inevitable. The leaders of the strike appealed
to the Confederation for help. The Confederal Committee
invited the workingmen of Paris to go out on a general
strike, but the invitation of the Confederation found
very little response, and the Post Office employees returned
to work.</p>

<p>The failure was ascribed to the &#8220;reformists&#8221;, M. Guérard,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
secretary of the Railway Workers, and to M. Niel,
who had delivered a speech on the eve of the general
strike declaring that the miners were not ready for it.
This speech, the revolutionaries alleged, produced an impression
disastrous for the general strike. The bitter
criticism of the revolutionists forced Niel to resign on
May 28, 1909. The election of Jouhaux secured the
triumph of the revolutionary syndicalists once more.</p>

<p>The dissensions between &#8220;reformists&#8221; and &#8220;revolutionaries&#8221;
became still more acute after the resignation of
M. Niel. The rumor that the &#8220;reformist&#8221; syndicats
would leave the Confederation circulated more persistently
than before. The &#8220;reformists&#8221; formed in July, 1909,
a <i>Comité d'Union Syndicaliste</i> to react against the anarchistic
syndicalism, to realize the union of workingmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
independent of all politics, in the exclusively economic
and industrial domain.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>  The situation was considered
very critical by both friends and enemies of the Confederation.</p>

<p>The struggle of tendencies and personalities within the
Confederation came to a climax at the next congress
held at Toulouse from Oct. 3 to Oct. 10, 1910. The
greater part of the time of the congress was consumed
in discussing the resignation of Niel, the accusations
against the former secretary Griffuelhes, and the quarrels
of &#8220;reformists&#8221; and revolutionists generally. Both
sides were disgusted with the proceedings, but hoped
that the atmosphere of mutual hostility and distrust
would be cleared thereby, and that a new period of harmonious
action would be the result.</p>

<p>The Congress was hardly over, when a strike unexpectedly
broke out among the railway men of the <i>Paris-Nord</i>.
The National Syndicat of Railway workers had
been considering the advisability of a general strike for
some time, but was postponing action in the hope of
effecting a peaceful settlement. The Syndicat of railway
workers was among the so-called &#8220;reformist&#8221; syndicats,
and its leaders laid great stress on peaceful negotiations
with employers and on soliciting the co-operation of the
government. The demands of the railway men were:
an increase in wages, one day of rest in the week, the
retroactive application of the old-age pension law passed
in 1909, and several other concessions relating to conditions
of work and matters of discipline. The railway
companies had refused to meet the representatives of
the railway men, and M. Briand, who was Premier at the
time, advised the officials of the railway union that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
could do nothing to make the railway companies change
their attitude. The leaders of the syndicat, however,
were still continuing their efforts to bring pressure to
bear upon the companies, when their plans were frustrated
by the sudden outbreak on the railroad system
known as Paris-Nord.</p>

<p>The strike, begun in Paris on October 10, rapidly
spread over the system Paris-Nord. The next day the
strike committee ordered a general railroad strike, and
the order was followed on October 12 by the Western
system of railroads. On October 13 M. Briand arrested
the members of the strike committee and ordered the
striking railway men under colors, thus putting them
under martial law. A second strike committee automatically
took the place of the leaders who were arrested,
but it did not display much energy. Besides, the response
to the strike order on the eastern and southern
railroad lines was very slight, and towards the end of
the week the strike was practically defeated. By order
of the second strike committee work was resumed on all
lines on October 18.</p>

<p>The failure of the railway strike was a heavy blow not
only to the syndicat of Railway Workers, but to the
general labor movement of France. It resulted in the
disorganization of one of the strongest syndicats and
added fuel to the dying embers of factional strife. The
revolutionary elements in the Confederation attributed
the failure of the strike to the hesitating tactics of the
&#8220;reformist&#8221; leaders and to the intervention of the
socialist politicians who tried to make political capital
out of the strike situation. The &#8220;reformists,&#8221; on the
other hand, accused the revolutionists of precipitating
the strike and of defeating the general movement by
hasty action on the Paris-Nord. Two facts, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
stand out clear: first, that the Confederation of Labor
did not direct the strike, which was a purely trade movement
largely dominated by reformist and political elements;
secondly, that the strike was defeated mainly by
the quick and energetic action of M. Briand, who treated
the strike as a revolt, sent soldiers to replace the strikers,
and mobilized the latter for military service.</p>

<p>The dissensions provoked by the railway strike accentuated
the &#8220;crisis&#8221; in the General Confederation of
Labor and hampered its activities. Still, amid these internal
struggles, the Confederal Committee made persistent
efforts to carry out the program of action which
was outlined for it at the congress of Toulouse. During
1910-1911 it carried on a relentless campaign against
the old-age pension law which was passed in April, 1910.
The French workingmen were opposed to the age limit
imposed by the law (65 years), to the system of capitalization,
and to the obligatory deductions of the worker's
contribution from his wages. The campaign was effective
to the extent of forcing several important modifications
in the law in favor of the workers.</p>

<p>At the same time the Confederation carried on a campaign
against the high cost of living ascribing it to
speculation and to the protective system. Meetings
were held throughout France, and demonstrations were
arranged; in many places bread riots took place in which
the leaders of the Bourses and of the Confederal Committee
took part.</p>

<p>But the greatest part of the energy of the Confederation
was directed against the wave of militarism and
nationalism which began to sweep France after the incident
of Agadir in the summer of 1910. The Confederation
of Labor felt that the labor movement in general
and the revolutionary tendencies in particular were endangered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
by the nationalist spirit and military excitement
which was stirring the country. Meetings were
organized all over France to protest against war and
militarism; several international meetings were arranged
in Berlin, Madrid, Paris, and London, at which speakers
representing all European countries spoke against war
and in favor of international peace. The idea of a general
strike in case of war was revived and agitated in the
syndicalist organizations as a warning to the French
government.</p>

<p>In September, 1912, the twelfth congress of the Confederation
was held at Toulouse. The report of the
Confederal Committee showed that the Confederation
was not making as much progress as before. The
growth of the General Confederation of Labor in relation
to the general labor movement of the country may
be judged from the following table:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The slackening in the growth of the Confederation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
was attributed partly to the persistent persecutions of
the government, but in the main to internal dissensions
and struggles. As a result of the latter, many of the
old militants who had taken a leading part in the syndicalist
organizations had become disillusioned and had left
the movement. Many of the syndicats had lost in membership,
and new syndicats were formed with great
difficulty.</p>

<p>The supreme effort of the Congress of Toulouse was,
therefore, to assert once more the leading ideas of syndicalism
and to unite all labor elements upon a common
platform of action. A long debate between representatives
of the various tendencies took place in consequence
of which the Congress reaffirmed the resolution of Amiens
(1906) known as the &#8220;charter of syndicalism.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>  The
most important resolution, however, was that in favor of
a general movement for the reduction of hours of labor,
particularly for the establishment of the &#8220;English week&#8221;
(La semaine Anglaise, i. e. half holiday on Saturday).
The Confederal Committee was authorized to carry on a
campaign similar in character to the Campaign of 1906
in favor of the eight hour day. To meet the necessary
expenses the dues were raised to ten francs per thousand
members for each Federation of industry and to seven
francs per thousand members for each Departmental
Union.</p>

<p>The discussion at the Congress of Toulouse showed
very clearly that the leaders of the syndicalist organizations
were becoming tired of perennial debates and that
they were anxious to save the Confederation from its
present critical condition by a vigorous campaign for
shorter hours, which would appeal to the mass of working
men and women. The Confederal Committee, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
has not been very successful in this since the congress
of Toulouse, for two principal reasons: the militaristic
excitement of Europe and the general industrial
depression. During 1913, the Confederation was engaged
in fighting the increase in military expenses and
particularly the passage of the three years' military
service law. In May and June a number of revolts took
place in the barracks, mainly among the soldiers who
would have been released in 1913, had not the new law
been made retroactive. The government accused the
Confederation of instigating the revolts of the soldiers,
and made numerous arrests among the leaders of the
principal syndicats in Paris and in the province. The
Confederation repudiated complicity in the revolts, but
asserted its right to maintain relations with the soldiers
by means of the <i>Sou du Soldat</i>. A number of protest
meetings were held in Paris and other cities against the
new military law, and there can be little doubt that this
agitation resulted in the modifications of the law which
practically reduced the actual time of service by several
months.</p>

<p>At the same time, the activities of the General Confederation
of Labor during 1913 revealed a conscious
determination to steer clear of hazardous movements of
a revolutionary character. In July, 1913, the Federations
of industries and the Bourses du Travail held their
third annual Conference in Paris, at which questions of
administration and policy were discussed. A number of
delegates demanded that a general strike be declared on
September 24, when the soldiers ought to have been
released from the barracks. This proposition was defeated
as an unwise measure. Among those who spoke
against the proposition were some of the ablest representatives
of the revolutionary syndicalists, like Jouhaux,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the general secretary; Merrheim, the secretary of the
Federation of the metal industry, and others. The
cautious action of the Confederation incensed the anarchist
groups who had supported the Confederation all
along, and they began to criticise the latter for &#8220;turning
to the right.&#8221; The leaders of the Confederation, however,
explained their action not by any change in ideas,
but by a desire to hew to the line of strictly labor demands
for the time being.</p>

<p>While making efforts to increase its strength at home,
the Confederation of Labor has been endeavoring in
recent years to spread the ideas of French syndicalism
abroad, and has been watching with great interest the
new tendencies in the labor movement of England and
the activities of the Industrial Workers of the World in
the United States. Its main efforts outside of France,
have been exerted at the conferences of the International
Secretariat of Labor. These conferences have
been held every two years since 1903 by the secretaries
of the adhering National Trade Union Centers.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>  The
General Confederation took part in the Conference of
Dublin in 1903, but sent no delegates to the Conferences
of Amsterdam (1905) or of Christiana (1907) because
these conferences refused to discuss the questions of the
general strike and of anti-militarism. The relations of
the Confederation to the International Secretariat have
been much discussed at the Congresses of the Confederation
and in the press. The Congress of Marseilles,
though approving the policy of the Confederal Committee,
recommended that the latter enter into closer
relations with the International Secretariat. Since then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the Confederation has taken part in the Conferences of
Paris in 1909,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>  Budapest (1911), and Zurich (1913).</p>

<p>In the International organization the Confederation
tries to enforce its views on the general strike and advocates
the organization of International Labor Congresses.
Its ideas meet here, however, with the opposition
of American, English, German and Austrian trades
unions. The latter are the more numerous. Germany
pays dues to the International Secretariat for 2,017,000
organized workingmen; the United States for 1,700,000;
England for 725,000; Austria for 480,000; France for
340,000. The total number of organized workingmen
affiliated with the International Secretariat is 6,033,500.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Character and Conditions of Revolutionary
Syndicalism</span></h2>

<p>The history of the General Confederation of Labor as
told in the preceding chapters has brought out in a general
way the character of revolutionary syndicalism and
the conditions which have influenced its rise and development.
It remains now in this last chapter to emphasize
the principal points and to strengthen them by
a more complete analysis of facts and conditions.</p>

<p>It has been maintained throughout this work that
revolutionary syndicalism was created by a <i>bloc</i> of revolutionary
elements in the Confederation. This character
of a <i>bloc</i> has been denied by many. Those hostile to the
Confederation are anxious to create the impression that
the latter is exclusively the creation and the tool of the
anarchists. Others more or less impartial fail to acknowledge
the part played in the movement by the non-anarchist
elements. Some anarchists themselves are
only too glad to be considered the creators of the movement
and to maintain a view which is a tribute to their
organizing ability and to their influence.</p>

<p>Many revolutionary syndicalists, however, protest
against being considered anarchists. Some of them are
active members of the Unified Socialist Party. Others
do not belong to the Socialist party, but have never been
connected with the Anarchists. They are revolutionary
syndicalists, &#8220;pure and simple.&#8221; And these two other
elements are by no means less influential in the Confederation
than the Anarchists.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The three elements enumerated have somewhat different
ways of regarding revolutionary syndicalism. To
the anarchists revolutionary syndicalism is but a partial
application of anarchist ideas. M. Yvetot, secretary of
the section of Bourses, said at the recent Congress of
Toulouse (1910): &#8220;I am reproached with confusing syndicalism
and anarchism. It is not my fault if anarchism
and syndicalism have the same ends in view. The former
pursues the integral emancipation of the individual;
the latter the integral emancipation of the workingman.
I find the whole of syndicalism in anarchism.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>To the revolutionary socialists in the Confederation
syndicalism is the primary and fundamental form of revolutionary
socialism. It does not exclude, however, other
forms; on the contrary, it must be completed by the political
organization of the Socialist party, because it has
no answer of its own to many social problems.</p>

<p>The third group of revolutionary syndicalists regards
revolutionary syndicalism as self-sufficing and independent
of both anarchism and socialism. This group, like
the first, emphasizes the fact that there is an irreconcilable
antagonism between syndicalism and political socialism.
&#8220;It is necessary,&#8221; writes Jouhaux, secretary of the Confederation,
&#8220;that the proletariat should know that between
parliamentary socialism, which is tending more and more
toward a simple democratization of existing social forms,
and syndicalism, which pursues the aim of a complete
social transformation, there is not only divergence of
methods, but particularly divergence of aims.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>Those who consciously call themselves revolutionary
syndicalists belong to one of the groups described, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the three groups constitute the <i>bloc</i> spoken of above.
To understand revolutionary syndicalism means to understand
this <i>bloc</i> of revolutionary elements, how it was
made possible, why it is maintained, and what conditions
have secured for it the leadership in the General
Confederation of Labor.</p>

<p>It has been shown in the preceding chapters that
since 1830 a considerable part of the French workingmen,
the so-called &#8220;militant&#8221; workingmen, have always
cherished the hope of a &#8220;complete&#8221; or &#8220;integral&#8221;
emancipation which should free them from the wage-system
and from the economic domination of the employer.
The desire of independence had guided the life
of the journeyman under the guild-system, and its birth
under modern economic conditions is natural enough
to need no explanation. But while under the guild-system
this desire had an individualistic character, under
the technical conditions of the present time it necessarily
led to collectivist ideas. With the development
of highly expensive means of production, only an insignificant
number of workingmen could hope to become
economically independent by individual action, and the
only way to attain economic freedom and equality for all
pointed to the collective appropriation of the means of
production and to the collective management of industrial
activities.</p>

<p>The insistence on economic freedom&mdash;in the sense
indicated&mdash;runs through all the literature of the French
Labor Movement. It is not only and not so much the
inequality of wealth, the contrasts of distribution that
stimulate the militant workingmen to their collectivist
hopes, as it is the protest against the &#8220;arbitrariness&#8221; of
the employer and the ideal of a &#8220;free workshop.&#8221; To
attain the latter is the main thing and forms the program
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of the General Confederation as formulated in the first
clause of its statutes.</p>

<p>The sensitiveness to economic inferiority is increased
in the French militant workingmen by the fact that in a
country like France economic distinctions are combined
with social distinctions. Owing to the traditions of the
past, economic classes are separated by a number of
other elements, in which intellectual, social and other
influences combine and which transform the economic
classes into social classes. The aspiration towards economic
equality increases, therefore, in volume and becomes
a striving after social equality.</p>

<p>The historical traditions of France combined with the
impatience for emancipation explain the revolutionary
spirit of the French socialist workingman. All who
have come into contact with French life have convinced
themselves of the power which the revolutionary traditions
of the past exert over the people. The French
workingman is brought up in the admiration of the men
of the Great Revolution; his modern history is full of
revolutionary secret societies, of insurrections, and of
revolutionary struggles. He cherishes the memory of
the Revolution of 1848, his indignation is aroused by the
story of the Days of June, his pity and sympathy are
stimulated by the events of the Commune. Looking
backward into the history of the past century and a half,
he can only get the feeling of political instability, and the
conviction is strengthened in him that &#8220;his&#8221; revolution
will come just as the revolution of the &#8220;Third-Estate&#8221;
had come. Combined with the desire to attain the
&#8220;integral&#8221; emancipation as soon as possible, these conditions
engender in him the revolutionary spirit.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
The revolutionary spirit predisposes the socialist workingman
to a skeptical attitude toward parliamentary
action which rests on conciliation and on compromise
and is slow in operation. He seeks for other methods
which seem to promise quicker results. The methods
themselves may change; they were insurrection once,
they are now the general strike. But the end they serve
remains the same: to keep up the hope of a speedy
liberation.</p>

<p>The distrust of parliamentary methods has been
strengthened in the French socialist workingman by
another fact. The French workingmen have seen their
political leaders rise to the very top, become Ministers
and Premiers (<i>e. g.</i>, Millerand, Viviani, Briand), and then
turn against their &#8220;comrades&#8221; of old. The feeling has
been thereby created in the socialist workingmen that
parliamentary methods are merely a means to a brilliant
career for individuals who know how to make use of
them.</p>

<p>The mistrust of &#8220;politicians&#8221; finds some nourishment
in the fact that the political leaders of the Socialist
movement are generally the &#8220;intellectuals,&#8221; between
whom and the workingmen there is also some antagonism.
The &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; are thrown out upon the social
arena principally by the lower and middle bourgeoisie
and generally enter the liberal professions. But whether
lawyer, writer, doctor or teacher, the French &#8220;intellectual&#8221;
sooner or later enters the field of &#8220;politics&#8221; which
allures him by the vaster possibilities it seems to offer.
In fact, the &#8220;intellectual&#8221; has always been a conspicuous
figure in the history of French Socialism. As a socialist
poet, Pierre Dupont, sang,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&#8220;Socialism has two wings,<br /></span>
<span>The student and the workingman.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
And as the socialist ideas have spread, the number of
&#8220;intellectuals&#8221; in the socialist movement has been constantly
increasing.</p>

<p>The &#8220;two wings&#8221; of the Socialists, however, cannot
perfectly adapt themselves to one another. The &#8220;intellectual&#8221;
generally lacks the &#8220;impatience for deliverance&#8221;
which characterizes the socialist workingman. The &#8220;intellectual&#8221;
is bound by more solid ties to the <i>status quo</i>;
his intellectual preoccupations predispose him to a calmer
view of things, to regard society as a slow evolutionary
process. Besides, the &#8220;intellectual&#8221; takes pride
in the fact that he supplies &#8220;the proletariat with fresh
elements of enlightenment and progress&#8221;; he is inclined,
therefore, to dominate the workingman as his &#8220;minor
brother&#8221;, and to advocate methods which secure his own
predominant part in the movement. Parliamentary action
is the field best adapted to his character and powers.
The socialist workingman, on the other hand, protests
against the tendencies of the &#8220;intellectual&#8221;, particularly
against the dominating impulses of the latter. He is
anxious to limit the powers of his leaders, if possible, and
to create such forms of organization as shall assure his
own independence.</p>

<p>When the syndicats began to develop in France, the
revolutionary workingmen seized upon them as a form
of organization particularly adapted to their demands.
The syndicat was an organization which could take up
the ideal of social emancipation; in the general strike,
which the syndicat seemed to carry within itself, there
was a method of speedy liberation; the syndicat excluded
the &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; and above all by its &#8220;direct
action&#8221; it maintained and strengthened the revolutionary
spirit and safeguarded the revolutionary ideal from
the compromises and dangers to which politics and the
parliamentary socialists subjected it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
These conditions: the hope of social emancipation, the
impatience for deliverance, the revolutionary spirit, and
the defiance of the &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; and of the &#8220;politicians,&#8221;
gave and continue to give life to revolutionary
syndicalism. They brought into being the &#8220;revolutionary
<i>bloc</i>&#8221; in the General Confederation of Labor and
maintain it there. Of course, differences of temperament
and shadings of opinion exist. On the one extreme
are those who are most vehement in their propaganda
and who combat the Socialist party; on the other,
are the revolutionary socialists who are disposed to co-operate
with the parliamentary socialists, but who want
to have an independent organization to fall back upon in
case of disagreement with the political party. But differing
in details, the revolutionary elements agree in the
main points and they stamp upon the Confederation the
character which it bears and which is described in the
terms &#8220;revolutionary syndicalism.&#8221;</p>

<p>The opponents of the revolutionary syndicalists claim
that the latter are followed only by a minority in the
General Confederation and that they maintain their leadership
by means of the existing system of representation
and by other more or less arbitrary devices. This statement,
however, cannot be proved in any satisfactory
way.</p>

<p>The best way of obtaining the exact number of revolutionary
syndicalists in the Confederation would seem
to be by means of an analysis of the votes taken at the
Congresses. This method, however, is defective for several
reasons. In the first place, not all the syndicats
adhering to the Confederation are represented at the
Congresses. At the Congress of Bourges (1904), 1,178
syndicats out of 1,792 were represented; at the Congress
of Amiens, 1,040 out of 2,399; at the Congress of Marseilles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
1,102 out of 2,586, and at the Congress of
Toulouse, 1,390 out of 3,012. It is evident, therefore,
that even if all the votes were taken unanimously, they
would still express the opinion of less than half the syndicats
of the Confederation.</p>

<p>In the second place, the votes of the Confederation
being taken by syndicats, to get the exact figures it
would be necessary to know how many syndicats in each
federation are revolutionary or not, and what is the proportional
strength of both tendencies in each syndicat.
This is impossible in the present state of statistical information
furnished by the Confederation.</p>

<p>At the Congress of Amiens, for instance, the vote approving
the report of the Confederal Committee (Section
of Federation) stood 815 against 106 (18 blanks).
This vote is important, because to approve or to reject
the report meant to approve or to reject the ideas by
which the General Confederation is guided.</p>

<p>Now, an analysis of the vote at Amiens shows that
while some organizations voted solidly for the Confederal
Committee, none voted solidly against it and that the
votes of many organizations were divided. But even the
number of those represented by the unanimous vote of
their syndicats cannot in the most cases be ascertained.
For instance, the agricultural syndicats cast their 28
votes for the Confederal Committee; the report of the
Confederal Committee gives the Federation of Agricultural
Laborers 4,405 members; but the same report
says that the Federation consisted of 106 syndicats; of
these 106 syndicats only 28 were represented at the
Congress, and how many members they represented
there is no possibility of ascertaining. The same is true
of those Federations in which the syndicats did not cast
the same vote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
This difficulty is felt by those who try to prove by figures
that the Confederation is dominated by a minority.
M. Ch. Franck, for instance, calculates that at the Congress
of Marseilles 46 organizations with 716 mandates
representing 143,191 members obtained the majority for
the <i>statu quo</i> against the proposition of proportional
representation; while the minority consisted of 15 organizations
with 379 mandates representing 145,440 members.
In favor of the anti-militaristic resolution, he calculates
further, 33 organizations with 670 mandates representing
114,491 members obtained the majority against 19 organizations
with 406 mandates representing 126,540 members.
But he is compelled to add immediately: &#8220;These figures
have no absolute value, because we have taken each organization
in its entirety, while in the same federation some
syndicats have not voted with the majority&#8221;; he thinks
that the proportion remains nevertheless the same because
he did not take into consideration the divisions on each
side.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The last assumption, however, is arbitrary, because the
syndicats dissenting on the one side may have been more
numerous than those not voting with the majority on the
other side; the whole calculation, besides, is fallacious,
because it takes the figures of the federations in their
entirety, while only a part of the syndicats composing
them took part in the votes.</p>

<p>The attempt, therefore, to estimate the exact number
of the revolutionary syndicalists in the Confederation
must be given up for the present. The approximate estimate
on either side can be given. According to M.
Pawlowski,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>  250,000 members of the Confederation (out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of 400,000) repudiate the revolutionary doctrine; the
revolutionary syndicalists, on the other hand, claim a majority
of two-thirds for themselves. The impartial student
must leave the question open.</p>

<p>It must be pointed out, however, that the system of
representation which exists now in the Confederation
affects both revolutionary and reformist syndicalists in a
more or less equal degree. At the Congress of Amiens,
for instance, the <i>Fédération du Livre</i>, with its 10,000
members, had 135 votes; the Railway Syndicat, with its
24,275 members, had only 36 votes; these two organizations
were among the &#8220;reformists&#8221; who combated the
Confederal Committee. On the other hand, the revolutionary
Federation of Metallurgy had 84 votes for its
14,000 members, but the Federation of Marine, which is
also revolutionary, disposed of six votes only for its 12,000
members. The revolutionary syndicalists, therefore,
may be right in their assertion that proportional representation
would not change the leadership of the Confederation.
This belief is strengthened in them by the
fact that in all so-called &#8220;reformist&#8221; organizations, as
the <i>Fédération du Livre</i>, the Railway Syndicat, etc.,
there are strong and numerous revolutionary minorities.</p>

<p>It is often asserted that only the small syndicats,
mostly belonging to the small trades, follow the revolutionary
syndicalists. This assertion, however, is inexact.
An examination of the syndicats which are considered
revolutionary shows that some of them are very large
and that others belong to the most centralized industries
of France. For instance, the Federation of Building
Trades is the most revolutionary organization in the
Confederation; at the same time it is the most numerous,
and its members pay the highest dues (after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
<i>Fédération du Livre</i>) in France.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>  The revolutionary
Federation of Metallurgy is also one of the large organizations
in the Confederation and belongs to an industry
which is one of the most centralized in France. The
total horse-power of machines used in the metallurgic
industries has increased from 175,070 in 1891 to 419,128
in 1906; the number of establishments has diminished
from 4,642 in 1891 to 4,544 in 1906; that is, the total
horse-power of machinery used in every industrial establishment
has increased during this period from 38 to
92;<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>  the number of workingmen per industrial establishment
has also increased from 508 in 1896 to 697 in 1901
and to 711 in 1906. In fact the metallurgic industry
occupies the second place after the mining industry
which is the most centralized in France.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>A diversity of conditions prevails in the industries to
which the other revolutionary organizations belong.
On the other hand, the so-called reformist organizations,
the Federation of Mines, the <i>Fédération du Livre</i>, the
Federation of Employees, differ in many respects and are
determined in their policy by many considerations and
conditions which are peculiar to each one of them.</p>

<p>The influence of the revolutionary syndicalists, therefore,
can be explained not by special technical conditions,
but by general conditions which are economic, political
and psychological. To bring out the relation of these
conditions to the syndicalist doctrine it is necessary to
analyze the latter into its constituent elements and to
discuss them one by one.</p>

<p>The fundamental condition which determines the policy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of &#8220;direct action&#8221; is the poverty of French syndicalism.
Except the <i>Fédération du Livre</i>, only a very few federations
pay a more or less regular strike benefit; the
rest have barely means enough to provide for their administrative
and organizing expenses and can not collect
any strike funds worth mentioning. In 1908, for instance,
there were 1,073 strikes; of these 837 were conducted
by organized workingmen. Only in 46 strikes
was regular assistance assured for the strikers, and in 36
cases only was the assistance given in money.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>  The
French workingmen, therefore, are forced to fall back on
other means during strikes. Quick action, intimidation,
<i>sabotage</i>, are then suggested to them by their very situation
and by their desire to win.</p>

<p>The lack of financial strength explains also the enthusiasm
and the sentiments of general solidarity which
characterize French strikes. An atmosphere of enthusiasm
must be created in order to keep up the fighting
spirit in the strikers. To the particular struggle in
any one trade a wider and more general significance
must be attributed; it must be interpreted as a partial
manifestation of a more general class-struggle. In this
way the determination to struggle on is strengthened in
those who strike and a moral justification is created for
an appeal to the solidarity of all workingmen. These
appeals are made constantly during strikes. Subscription
lists are kept in the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>, in the
Confederal Committee on Strikes, and are opened in the
workingmen's and socialist newspapers whenever any
big strike occurs.</p>

<p>New means to make up for the lack of financial resources
are constantly devised. Of these means two which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
have come into existence within recent years are the
<i>soupes communistes</i> and the &#8220;exodus of children.&#8221; The
<i>soupes communistes</i> are organized by the <i>Bourses du Travail</i>
and consist of meals distributed to those on strike.
The <i>soupes communistes</i> permit the feeding of a comparatively
large number of strikers at small expense. Distribution
occurs at certain points. The workingmen, if they
wish, may take their meals home. The last Conferences
of the section of Bourses have discussed the question how
to organize these <i>soupes communistes</i> more systematically
and as cheaply as possible.</p>

<p>The &#8220;exodus of children&#8221; consists in sending away the
children of the strikers to workingmen of other towns
while the strike is going on. It has been used during
several strikes and attracted widespread attention. The
&#8220;exodus of children&#8221; relieves the strikers at home
and creates sympathy for them over the country at large.</p>

<p>Financial weakness has also led French syndicats in
recent years to reconsider the question of co-operation.
Various federations have expressed themselves at their
federal congresses in favor of &#8220;syndicalist co-operatives&#8221;
in which all associates are at the same time members of
the syndicat and organized on a communist basis. The
main argument brought forward in favor of such co-operatives
is the support they could furnish to workingmen
on strike.</p>

<p>The poverty of the French syndicats is the result of the
reluctance of the French workingmen to pay high dues.
In the <i>Fédération du Livre</i>, which has the highest dues,
every member pays a little over two francs a month. In
other federations the dues are lower, coming down in some
organizations to 10 centimes a month. In recent years
there has been a general tendency in all federations to increase
dues, but the efforts of the syndicalist functionaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in this direction have met with but slow and partial success.</p>

<p>The reluctance to high dues is in part the result of
the comparatively low wages which prevail in France.
Another factor is the psychology of the French workingman.
&#8220;Our impulsive and rebellious (<i>frondeur</i>)
temperament,&#8221; wrote the Commission which organized
the Congress of Montpellier, &#8220;does not lend itself to
high dues, and if we are always ready to painful sacrifices
of another nature, we have not yet been able to
understand the enormous advantages which would follow
from strong syndicalist treasuries maintained by higher
assessments.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>  The French workingmen are conscious
of their peculiar traits, and the literature of the syndicalist
movement is full of both jeremiads and panegyrics
with regard to these traits, according to the speaker
and to the circumstances. The French workingmen
recognize that they lack method, persistence and foresight,
while they are sensitive, impulsive and combative.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The result of this psychology is not only poor syndicats,
but syndicats weak in other respects. Many syndicats
are but loosely held together, are easily dissolved
and are composed of a more or less variable and shifting
membership. The instability is increased of course by
the absence of benevolent features in the syndicats. The
<i>Fédération du Livre</i> alone pays sick and other benefits.</p>

<p>The weakness of the syndicats predisposes the French
workingmen to more and more generalized forms of
struggle. Syndicats on strike impelled by the desire to
increase their forces try to involve as many trades and
workingmen as possible and to enhance their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
chances by enlarging the field of struggle. This is why
such general movements, as the movement for an eight-hour
day in 1906, described in the preceding chapter,
are advocated by the syndicats. The latter feel that in
order to gain any important demand they must be
backed by as large a number of workingmen as possible.
But in view of their weakness, the syndicats can start a
large movement only by stirring up the country, by
formulating some general demand which appeals to all
workingmen. The same conditions explain in part the
favor which the idea of the general strike has found in
the syndicats.</p>

<p>Such forms of struggle must necessarily bring the
syndicats into conflict with the State, particularly in
France where the State is highly centralized and assumes
so many functions. With a people so impulsive
as the French, the intervention of the forces of the State
in the economic struggles must inevitably lead to collisions
of a more or less serious character. The result is
a feeling of bitterness in the workingmen towards the
army, the police and the government in general. The
ground is thus prepared for anti-militaristic, anti-State
and anti-patriotic ideas.</p>

<p>The organized workingmen are a minority of the
working-class. Still they must act as if they were the
majority or the entirety of the workingmen. The contradiction
must be smoothed over by some explanation,
and the theory of the &#8220;conscious minority&#8221; arises to
meet the situation. The weaker the syndicats and the
more often they are exposed to the danger of dissolution
the greater the necessity of the theory. A disorganized
syndicat generally leaves behind a handful of militant
workingmen determined to keep up the organization.
The theory of the &#8220;conscious minority&#8221; is both a stimulus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to and a justification for the activities of these persistent
&#8220;militants.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the conditions described the French love of theory,
of high-sounding phrases, and of idealistic formulas must
be added. For a Frenchman it is not sufficient to act
under necessity: the act must be generalized into a
principle, the principles systematized, and the system of
theory compressed into concise and catching formulas.
And once abstracted, systematized and formulated, the
ideas become a distinct force exerting an influence in the
same direction as the conditions to which they correspond.</p>

<p>When all this is taken into account, it is easier to
understand the influence of the revolutionary syndicalists.
It is insufficient to explain their leadership by
clever machinations of the Confederal Committee, as
M. Mermeix and many others do. It is quite true that
the Confederal Committee tries to maintain its power by
all means possible. It sends out delegates to Federal
Congresses, on conference tours over the country, to
assist workingmen on strikes, etc. In most cases it
sends only men who represent the revolutionary ideas of
the Committee and who, therefore, strengthen the influence
of the latter by word and deed. It is also true
that in most <i>Bourses du Travail</i> the secretaries are
revolutionary and that they help to consolidate the influence
of the Confederal Committee. But these secretaries
have not usurped their power. They are elected
because they have come to the front as speakers, writers,
organizers, strike-leaders, etc. And they could come to
the front only because conditions were such as to make
their ideas and services helpful.</p>

<p>Whatever one's attitude to the Confederation, one
must acknowledge the results it has achieved. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
strike statistics of France, given in the following table,
show the following facts:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="10" summary="Table 13">

<tr><td align="center">1899-1908</td><td align="center">35.79</td><td align="center">25.83</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Of course, these results can not be attributed entirely to
the action of the Confederation. On the other hand,
the influence of the Confederation on the improvement
of general conditions of employment, on social legislation,
etc., is undeniable. &#8220;In all branches of human
activity,&#8221; says M. Pawlowski, &#8220;wages have risen with a
disconcerting and disquieting rapidity.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>  The agitation
for the eight-hour day and the rising of 1906 hastened
the vote on the weekly rest, induced the government to
consider the application of the ten-hour day, popularized
the practice of the &#8220;English week,&#8221; etc.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Whether the same or better results could have been
obtained by &#8220;reformist&#8221; methods, is not a question to
be considered, because in most cases the syndicats have
no choice. A strike once begun, the character of the
struggle is determined by conditions which exist and
not by any that would be desirable. This is proved by
the fact that very often the so-called &#8220;reformist&#8221; syndicats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
carry on their struggles in the same way and by the
same methods as do the revolutionary ones.</p>

<p>The comparative influence of the Confederation explains
the fact why the &#8220;reformists&#8221; do not leave the organization,
though they are bitter in their opposition to the
revolutionists. The &#8220;reformists&#8221; feel that they would
thereby lose a support which is of value to them. Besides,
in many cases such an act would lead to divisions within
the reformist federations, all of which, as already indicated,
contain considerable revolutionary minorities.</p>

<p>The revolutionary syndicalists, however, are in their
turn compelled to make concessions to those exigences
of the labor movement which have nothing to do with
revolutionary ends. Of course, the revolutionary syndicalists
are workingmen and they are interested in the immediate
improvement of economic conditions. But
there can be little doubt that the leaders and the more
conscious and pronounced revolutionary syndicalists are
mainly interested in their revolutionary ideal, in the abolition
of capitalism and of the wage-system. The struggles
for higher wages, shorter hours, etc., are a necessity
which they must make a virtue of while awaiting the hoped-for
final struggle. And when they theorize about the
continuity of the struggles of to-day with the great struggles
of to-morrow, when they interpret their every-day
activities as part of a continuous social warfare, they are
merely creating a theory which in its turn justifies their
practice and preserves their revolutionary fire from extinction.</p>

<p>But theorizing does not essentially change the character
of all syndicalist activities. The Confederal Committee
must attend to the administrative and other questions,
such as the questions of <i>viaticum</i>, of the label, etc. The
necessities of the syndical movement often lead the members
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
of the Confederal Committee into the antechambers
of Parliament or into the private rooms of the Ministers
whose assistance is solicited. The most revolutionary
federations can not help entering into negotiations with
employers for the settlement of strikes. In practice,
therefore, the distinction between &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; and
&#8220;reformist&#8221; syndicalists is often obscured, because both
act as they must and not as they would.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>This must not be interpreted to mean that there is any
conscious hypocrisy or undue personal interest on the
part of the leaders of the revolutionary syndicalists. On
the contrary, the most bitter opponents of the Confederation
must admit that the reverse is true. &#8220;However
one may judge their propaganda,&#8221; says M. Mermeix, &#8220;he
is obliged to acknowledge the disinterestedness of the
libertarians who lead the syndicalist movement. They do
not work for money....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>  There is also no field in
the Confederation for political ambition. Still the movement
has its demands which require suppleness and pliability
on the part of the leaders and which make impossible
the rigid application of principles.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the revolutionary syndicalists have
in the syndicats a tremendous force for their revolutionary
ends. The close relation of syndical life to all political
and economic problems gives the Confederal Committee
the opportunity to participate in all questions of
interest. The high cost of living, the danger of a war,
the legislative policy of the government, troubles among
the wine-growers, any public question, indeed, is the
occasion for the intervention of the Confederal Committee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
The latter appears, then, also as a revolutionary
organization which is always ready to criticise, to discredit
and to attack the government, and which is openly
pursuing the overthrow of existing institutions in France.
And when one keeps in mind the indefatigable anti-militaristic
and anti-patriotic propaganda carried on by
the <i>Bourses du Travail</i> all over the country, the revolutionary
character of the Confederation may be fully appreciated.</p>

<p>What is the future that may be predicted for the General
Confederation of Labor? Will the synthesis of
revolutionism and of unionism that has been achieved in
it continue more or less stable until the &#8220;final&#8221; triumph
of the revolutionary syndicalists? Or will the latter be
overpowered by the &#8220;reformist&#8221; elements who will impress
their ideas on the Confederation and who will
change the character of French syndicalism?</p>

<p>These questions cannot at present be answered. The
movement is so young that no clear tendencies either
way can be discerned. The two possibilities, however,
may be considered in connection with the conditions
that would be required to transform them into realities.</p>

<p>Those who predict a change in the character of French
syndicalism generally have the history of English Trades
Unionism in mind. They compare revolutionary syndicalism
to the revolutionary period of English Trades
Unionism and think of the change that came about in
the latter in the third quarter of the past century. But
the comparison is of little value, because the conditions
of France are different from those of England, and because
the international economic situation to-day is very
different from what it was fifty years ago.</p>

<p>It is probable that if the French syndicats should develop
into large and strong unions, highly centralized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and provided with large treasuries, other ideas and
methods would prevail in the syndicalist movement.
But this change is dependent on a change in the economic
life of France. France must cease to be &#8220;the
banker of Europe,&#8221; must cease to let other countries
use its piled-up millions<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>  for the development of their
natural resources and industry, and must devote itself to
the intensification of its own industrial activities. Such
a change could bring about greater productivity, higher
wages, and a higher concentration of the workingmen
of the country. This change in conditions of life might
result in a modification of the psychology of the French
workingmen, though how rapid and how thorough-going
such a process could be is a matter of conjecture. But
whether France will or can follow the example of England
or of Germany, in view of its natural resources and
of the situation of the international market, it does not
seem possible to say.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>  Besides, to change completely
the character of French syndicalism, it would be necessary
to wipe out the political history of France and its
revolutionary traditions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the triumph of the revolutionary
syndicalists presupposes a total readjustment of groups
and of interests. The Confederation counts now about
600,000 members. Official statistics count over 1,000,000
organized workingmen in France. But it must be
remembered that the federations underestimate their
numbers for the Confederation in order to pay less,
while they exaggerate their numbers for the <i>Annuaire
Statistique</i> in order to appear more formidable. The
Confederation, besides, for various reasons rejects a
number of organizations which desire to join it. It may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
be safe to say, therefore, that the Confederation brings
under its influence the greater part of the organized
workingmen of France.</p>

<p>But the total number of workingmen in France, according
to the Census of 1906, is about 10,000,000, of
which about 5,000,000 are employed in industry and in
transportation. The numbers of independent producers
in industry, commerce, and agriculture is about 9,000,000,
of which about 2,000,000 are <i>petits patrons</i>. Over
a million and a half persons are engaged in the liberal
professions and in the public services.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Among the latter the revolutionary syndicalists have
met with success in recent years. The ideas of revolutionary
syndicalism have gained adherents among the
employees of the Post Office, Telegraph and Telephone,
and among the teachers of the public schools. The
recent Congresses of the teachers have declared themselves
ready to collaborate with the workingmen for the
realization of their ideal society. The following motion
adopted by the recent Congress of Nantes, at which 500
delegates were present, is very characteristic: &#8220;The professional
associations of teachers (men and women),
employees of the State, of the Departments and of the
Communes,&#8221; reads the motion, &#8220;assembled in the
<i>Bourses du Travail</i>, declare their sympathy for the
working-class, declare that the best form of professional
action is the syndical form; express their will to work
together with the workingmen's organizations for the
realization of the Social Republic.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Also among the industrial and commercial middle
classes there are some who look with favor on syndicalism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
The French middle classes have for the last quarter
of a century tried to organize themselves for resistance
against the &#8220;financial feudalism&#8221; from which they suffer.
Several organizations have been formed among the small
merchants and masters, and in 1908 the &#8220;Association
for the Defense of the Middle Classes&#8221; was constituted.
The president of this Association, M. Colrat, wrote:
&#8220;The ideas of the bourgeois syndicalism on the future
are the same as those of the workingmen's syndicalism....
Far from contradicting one another, the syndicalism
of the middle classes and the syndicalism of the
working-classes reinforce each other in many respects,
and notwithstanding many vexations, they lead to a
state of relative equilibrium by a certain equality of opposing
forces.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>  In the struggle against the big capitalists
the leaders of the middle classes appear to be
ready to form an alliance with the working-class. There
can be little doubt, however, that the middle classes in
general are opposed to the revolutionary ideals of the
syndicalists. To succeed, the revolutionary syndicalists
must bring about a change in the attitude of these
classes, for the history of France has shown that the
fear of &#8220;Communism&#8221; may throw the middle classes
into the arms of a Caesar.</p>

<p>Whatever possibility may become a reality, France seems
destined to go through a series of more or less serious
struggles. Hampered by the elements which hark back
to the past and which have not yet lost all importance,
disorganized by the revolutionists who look forward to
the future for the realization of their ideal, the Republic
of France is still lacking the stability which could save
her from upheavals and from historical surprises. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
highly centralized form of government and the dominating
position which Paris still holds in the life of France
make such surprises easier and more tempting than would
otherwise be the case. The process of social readjustment
which is going on all over the world at present, therefore,
must lead in France to a more or less catastrophic collision
of the discordant elements which her political and
economic history have brought into existence.</p>

<p>The struggle has already begun. The government of
the Republic is determined to put an end to the revolutionary
activities of the syndicalists. It is urged on by
all those who believe that only the weakness of the Government
has been the cause of the strength of the Syndicalists.
On the other hand, the Syndicalists are determined
to fight their battle to the end. What the outcome may
be is hidden in the mystery of the future. <i>Qui vivra&mdash;verra</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_180" id="Footnote_180" href="#FNanchor_180"><span class="label">[180]</span></a> In 1906 the statutes were so modified as to admit no new trade federations.
This was a decided step in the direction of the industrial form
of organization.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_181" id="Footnote_181" href="#FNanchor_181"><span class="label">[181]</span></a> At the last congress of the Confederation which was held in Havre
in September, 1912, a resolution was passed that the Bourses du Travail
in each Department of France should form Departmental Unions
(Unions Departmentales), and that on January 1, 1914, these Departmental
Unions should take the place of the Bourses du Travail in the organization
of the Confederation. The resolution has not yet been fully
carried into effect, and the process of reorganization is still going on.
When it is completed, the General Confederation of Labor will emerge
with a more compact and centralized form of organization embracing
Federations of industry, on the one hand, and Departmental Unions, on
the other. The single Bourses will not disappear, and their functions will
not be curtailed; but they will henceforth form the constituent elements
of the more comprehensive Departmental Unions and will have no individual
representation in the Confederal Committee. The reorganization
was made necessary by the rapid growth of Bourses du Travail,
the number of which far outstripped the number of Federations of industry
and which thus controlled the policies of the Confederal Committee.
The number of the Departmental Unions can not exceed
eighty-seven (87), as there are but eighty-seven political subdivisions
in France called Departments.</p>
